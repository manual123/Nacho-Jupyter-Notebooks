    "In this example, you will apply machine learning methods to predict the incidence of diabetes amongst Pima Indians. As with other data science/machine learning problems, many different methods may be applicable, and you should try a few to see how effective each is. A vague outline to solve this problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import data and get a general sense for the data\n",
    "2. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to see if any patterns emerge\n",
    "3. Apply classification methods to predict the incidence of diabetes\n",
    "   - Don't forget to split into training and testing datasets!\n",
