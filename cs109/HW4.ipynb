The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items. CF thus relies on users' past behavior.\n",

In the latter approach you have a model of hidden factors through which users and items are transformed to the same space. For example, if you are rating movies we may transform items into genre factors, and users into their preference for a particular genre.\n", 
            "\n", 
            "Factor models generally lead to more accurate recommenders. One of the reasons for this is the sparsity of the item-user matrix. Most users tend to rate barely one or two items. Latent factor models are more expressive, and fit fewer parameters. However, neighborhood models are more prevalent, as they have an intuitive aspect that appeals to users(if you liked this you will like that) and online(a new preference can be incorporated very quickly).\n",

Thus, most neighborhood based systems such as Amazon these days rely on item-item approaches. In these methods, a rating is estimated by other ratings made by the user on \"similar\" or \"nearby\" items: we have a K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm, in effect."

            "In the previous section we implemented a **procedure** (a set of instructions for processing data) for giving recommendations and predicting user ratings for restaurants. This procedure involved a number of arbitrary choices -- for example, the particular measure of similarity between restaurants, or the weighting scheme for constructing a predicted rating. It also gave no sense of uncertainty -- in the case of giving recommendations, there was no statement about how we would expect the ranking from the procedure to compare to the user's true opinions of restaurants, and in the case of predicting ratings, there was no confidence interval for the prediction.\n", 
            "\n", 
            "It is possible in repeated applications of the above procedure to see how it performs in the long run. Based on this long-run performance we could potentially justify certain functional choices and compute measurements of uncertainty. This framework of proposing a procedure first, then evaluating its performance in real or hypothetical replications of the experiment is an example of a *frequentist* approach to a problem. One aspect of the frequentist approach is that the proposed procedure does not necessarily have to be derived from a model (although it often is). While this means that a proposed procedure may be more flexible or robust than a model-based procedure, it also means that there is no natural way to justify certain functional choices or construct uncertainty estimates.\n", 
            "\n", 
            "In contrast, the *Bayesian* approach to a problem always begins with a **probablistic model** for how the data were generated. Assuming this model is true, the posterior distribution over unknown quantities (either parameters to be estimated or unobserved data to be predicted) gives a single coherent expression of what the observed data tell us about the unknowns. By summarizing the posterior distribution, we can derive the exact functional form of a procedure for constructing estimates or predictions. We call a procedure derived from this Bayesian approach a **Bayes rule** (not to be confused with Bayes' Theorem). Using the posterior distribution, we can also give a sense of how uncertain we are about the estimate or prediction we have constructed.\n",

We will take a Bayesian approach here, and construct our estimates and predictions from summaries of the *posterior distribution* of the model's parameters, which we will compute using a *Gibbs sampler*. We will also give measures of uncertainty based on the posterior distribution. We will evaluate predictions from this approach in the same way we evalutated predictions from the KNN procedure above."

            "The central dogma in constructing a recommendation system using collaborative filtering is that *similar users will rate similar restaurants similarly*. In the previous section, we explicitly encoded this idea by using a similarity function to identify similar restaurants. We also assumed that either all users were the same (the global approach) or that only the current user was similar enough to make a recommendation (the user-specific approach). In this section, we will use a model that allows us to identify both similar users and similar restaurants as a function of **latent factors**.\n", 
            "\n", 
            "We can think of latent factors as properties of restaurants (e.g., spiciness of food or price) that users have a positive or negative preference for. We do not observe these factors or the users' preferences directly, but we assume that they affect how users tend to rate restaurants. For example, if a restaurant serves a lot of spicy food and a user dislikes spicy food, then the restaurant would have a high \"spiciness\" factor, and the user would have a strongly negative preference, resulting in a prediction of a low rating. Note that if users have similar preferences, then according to the model, they will behave similarly, and likewise, if restaurants have similar latent factors, they will be rated similarly by similar users. Latent factors thus give us an intuitive way to specify a generative model the obeys the central dogma.\n", 
            "\n", 
            "One issue that comes up with latent factor models is determining how many latent factors to include. There may be a number of different unmeasured properties that affect ratings in different ways -- for example, in addition to the spiciness factor above, there may also be a price factor that affects how users rate a restaurant. We deal with the problem of choosing the number of latent factors to include in the same way we deal with choosing $K$ in a $K$-nearest neighbors problem.\n",

To submit your homework, create a folder named lastname_firstinitial_hw4 and place your solutions in the folder. Double check that the file is still called HW4.ipynb, and that it contains your code. Also include the `computesim.py` script and the `output.small.local.txt` data file. Do **NOT** include the data file `output.full.emr.txt` from the larger run (its huge, so we will check your answers to 4.4 instead). Compress the folder (please use .zip compression) and submit to the CS109 dropbox in the appropriate folder.
