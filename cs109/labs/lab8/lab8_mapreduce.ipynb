Section 4 of that homework includes new python techniques (classes, inheritance), an unfamiliar approach to breaking up large computing problems (MapReduce), code that has to be run outside the friendly confines of an ipython notebook, and then you are asked to put it all to use on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This sounds very complicated, but the end result is a simpler algorithm for that problem of calculating similarity scores, as well as the ability to expand to arbitrarily large data sets."
