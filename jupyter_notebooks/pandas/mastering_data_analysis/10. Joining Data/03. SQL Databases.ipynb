    "## Primary and Foreign Keys\n",
    "A key component of relational databases is the idea of primary and foreign keys. A primary key is a column whose value uniquely identifies each row in the table. A foreign key is a primary key located in a different table than where it is the primary key. A foreign key is not unique and can appear any number of times within its table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram, all the primary keys have a little key symbol next to them. For example, in the `tracks` table, `TrackId` is a primary key and (should) guarantee us that each value in that column is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `tracks` table has several foreign keys in it as well - `AlbumId`, `MediaTypeId`, and `GenreId`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships between tables\n",
    "The relationships between the tables are mapped with lines in the diagram. These lines connect a column of one table to a column in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the symbol right before the line connects to each table. The symbols with a single \"prong\" mean that there is one (or at most one) unique values in that column. The multiple pronged symbol means that there each value can appear more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, look at the single-pronged symbol from the `media_types` table connected to the multi-pronged symbol at the `tracks` table. This means that for each `MediaTypeId` in the `media_types`, it might be found multiple times in the `tracks` table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the relationship in the opposite direction - each `MediaTypeId` in the tracks table is found exactly one time in the `media_types` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a one-to-many or a many-to-one relationship. Two single-pronged symbols are a one-to-one relationship. Tables can be set up so there are many-to-many relationships, but this is discouraged."
