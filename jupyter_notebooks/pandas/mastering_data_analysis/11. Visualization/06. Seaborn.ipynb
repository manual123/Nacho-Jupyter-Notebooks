    "# Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers the Seaborn visualization library in Python. Seaborn has a high-level, easy-to-use interface for creating powerful and beautiful visualizations. Seaborn relies on matplotlib to do all the heavy lifting. Sometimes, Seaborn is referred to as a **wrapper** for matplotlib, a library which is more difficult to use but provides more fine-grained control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Seaborn documentation][1] is good and fairly concise. You will be well-served to read all of it. The library is fairly minimal and only exposes a relatively few amount of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seaborn integration with pandas\n",
    "Nearly all Seaborn plotting functions contain a `data` parameter that accepts a pandas DataFrame. This allows you to use **strings** of the column names for the function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seaborn and Tidy data\n",
    "Seaborn plotting functions work best with tidy data. Tidy data makes plotting with seaborn easy. The three tidy principles are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every variable forms a column\n",
    "* Every row forms an observation\n",
    "* Each observational unit forms its own table\n",
    "\n",
    "### The three categories of plots - Distribution plots, Grouping and aggregating plots, and Raw Data plots\n",
    "I like to segregate Seaborn plotting functions into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distribution plots** - These plots show the distribution of some set of points of a continuous valued variable. Examples of these are box, violin, histogram and KDE plots\n",
    "* **Grouping and aggregating** - These plots group by some categorical variable and aggregate another. For example, in the employee dataset below, we can use a bar plot to find the average salary by race. Examples of these plots are bar, count, and point plots. Seaborn also allows for aggregation with line plots.\n",
    "* **Raw data plots** - These plots do not do anything to the data other than display it. Some examples are scatter and line plots along with heatmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The four common Seaborn plotting function parameters - `x`, `y`, `hue`, and `data`\n",
    "The Seaborn API is easy to use and most of the plotting functions look very similar. They syntax will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sns.plotting_func(x='col1', y='col2', hue='col3', data=df)```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will always pass your DataFrame to the `data` parameter. For univariate plots, you can use exactly one of `x` or `y`. The `hue` parameter adds an extra level of dimensionality by splitting and coloring the data by a third variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Read in City of Houston Employee Data\n",
    "We will start with a public dataset produced from the City of Houston. The data is tidy and ready to be immediately visualized with Seaborn.\n",
