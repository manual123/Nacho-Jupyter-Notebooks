    "# Matplotlib Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python and is often used in publications. It was originally built to mimic the functionality of plotting with [Matlab][0]. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Interfaces\n",
    "There are two separate ways to interface with Matplotlib. One is called the **state-machine environment** and the other is with an **object-oriented** approach. The state-machine environment (known as **pyplot** from here on out) is a complex term for saying that Matplotlib implicitly handles some of the plotting for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **object-oriented** approach gives you full control over each element of the plot and is the more Pythonic way of interacting with Matplotlib. It is suggested you use the object-oriented approach. Most examples may be reproduced with either approach, but the object-oriented approach is explicit and, in my opinion, easier to determine what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using only the object-oriented approach\n",
    "This notebook only uses the object-oriented approach, as attempting to learn both at the start is not necessary and confusing. Many examples online use pyplot so it is something that you will eventually need to understand. Thankfully, much of the code between each approach looks quite similar when making a single plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Figure\n",
    "\n",
    "![][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a hierarchy you must understand when plotting with Matplotlib. The highest and outermost part of a plot is the **Figure**. The Figure contains all the other plotting elements. Typically, you do not interact with it much. Inside the Figure is the **Axes**. This is the actual plotting surface that you normally would refer to as a 'plot'. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Figure may contain any number of these **Axes**. The **Axes** is a container for all of the other physical pixels that get drawn onto your screen. This includes the x and y axis, lines, text, points, legends, images, etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "### Axes is a confusing word\n",
    "The term **Axes** is not actually plural and does not mean more than one axis. It literally stands for a single 'plot'. It's unfortunate that this fundamental element has a name that is so confusing.\n",

    "To use embed plots created from matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook you need to run the magic command `%matplotlib inline`. This will embed your matplotlib plots into the output of the cells. If you don't do this, you will have to call the `show` method from your Figure object, which produces a plot in a separate window."

    ">>> import matplotlib\n",

    "When you `import pandas as pd`, you get access to nearly all of the available functions and classes of the Pandas library. This isn't true with Matplotlib. Instead, much of the functionality for quickly plotting is found in the pyplot module. If you navigate to the matplotlib source directory, found in your site-packages directory, you will see a `pyplot.py` file. This is the module that you are importing into your workspace.\n",
