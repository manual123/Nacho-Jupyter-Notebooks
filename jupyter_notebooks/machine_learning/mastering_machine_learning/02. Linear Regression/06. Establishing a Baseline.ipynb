    "# Establishing a Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "For most human endeavors it helps to begin by establishing a baseline. This baseline may be used to track performance over time. For instance, if you have decided to lose weight, a baseline would be your starting weight. You could also track the exact number and type of calories you eat for a few weeks before beginning any sort of diet. Similar baselines can be made for lifting weights, running, learning data science, etc... Without establishing a baseline, tracking progress becomes more difficult.\n",

    "### No previous baseline was established\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous work with the housing dataset, we never established a baseline. We went straight into modeling with a single-variable linear regression. Let's read in the housing dataset and reproduce this result."
