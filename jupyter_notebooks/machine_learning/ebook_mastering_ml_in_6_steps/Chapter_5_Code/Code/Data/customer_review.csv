1,Excellent service my claim was dealt with very swiftly without any hassle.
2,Very sympathetically dealt within all aspects of a very distressing happening. No arguing or haggling relating to the theft of various items.
3,"Having received yet another ludicrous quote from our previous insurer of over 25 years loyalty I looked at  having had the superb experience of their assistance via travel insurance while abroad. I was amazed and delighted by the quality of the offered products - both buildings and contents cover.
The range of cover is excellent and it can be tailored to be upgraded if needed.This is not expensive! I bought cover immediately. I feel really happy with my cover and feel secure with this company.
I cannot recommend them highly enough.
Thank you  for looking after your customers so well and professionally."
4,Very prompt and fair handling of claim. A minor problem concerning late carpet delivery was quickly resolved
5,Very good and excellent value for money simple to use web site.
6,Have a perennial problem with home cover for my sisters house - bought by me from her as a private equity release some 16 years ago. Normal insurance for \my\ home not occupied by me has been difficult restrictive expensive or impossible.  took on board the problem quickly simply and inexpensively. This confirmed an excellent example when my stolen car keys were sorted (without charge) by my  car insurance. So though no experience of any of house claims yet (hopefully never) I feel very happy and comfortable with my purchase. Thank you . No connection other than as a satisfied customer.
7,I feel that my claim was delayed by the involvement and action (lack of) by Asprea
8,Every aspect of the claim was settled politely and efficiently. What you hope for with insurance claims but seldom seem to get
9,Thank you that my claim has been sorted out but was a little shocked that I had a ï¿½200 excess on my claim which I should have checked clearly before taking out the policy. (so beware). The staff I spoke to were very friendly and dealt with my questions as efficiently as they could so talking to staff was a very positive experience. I had the ring listed as extra items but dont know what it would have been like if I hadnt. Hope you find this review helpful.
10,"Telephone claim. Helpful staff. Simple process. No paperwork. Money in bank within a matter of days.
Couldnt fault the system."
11,I can only say that  have given me quality of assurance and help when reqired. I have tried other insurers but come back to  as they reward loyalty rather than at the expense of new customers. Obviously if this were to change Id be out ther looking for fresh deals but since I have been with them I cannot find better coverage.
12,Great customer service and a brilliant price. I would say to anyone to try  first.
13,We were looking for an insurance company that would be easy to contact. Rang  and spoke to a lady who was both very efficient and helpful. The price was good and so we decided to give  a go. Easy website to understand. So far so good!
14,Dealt with my claim efficiently when I eventually managed to obtain quotes!
15,On New years day my Son was using his computer and shouted Mum I got wet feet. Upon investicating we found water had come in the window in the bedroom and soaked through the ceiling down the walls and made the new carpet wet.Luckily I had another bedroom I could move into once the junk was moved.I phoned the helpline and was told to go ahead with the repair and someone would install dehumidifiers to dry everything out. I was phoned or emailed to ask if I needed anything and they were there if I need them. After everything was put right the invoice was sent off and within 2 days the advisor was on the phone to discuss my claim. They offered a fair settlement and this was paid within the week. The advisor took a lot of the stress out of the situation.
16,"When I first telephoned to find out if I was covered for the accidental damage to my wifes glasses the  claims person at the other end of the line did not know and kept me waiting on the phone for a while before they came back to confirm that I was. This followed what I consider as more of an interrogation rather than being helpful questioning from  almost to the point where I was beginning to feel guilty for claiming!!
Eventually I was told to go away and obtain an estimate and email it back to  for it to be considered which puzzled me as I thought that I was covered anyway?
I emailed the estimate after a few days to the claims person as requested and within a few days I was sent a cheque less my excess which was good however it was so impersonal there was no acknowledgement to my email and the estimate no further contact was made with me either via telephone or email from the claims dept ...so much for the personal touch  advertises."
17,On Friday 9 August 2013 we had a kitchen fire at 1800. I rang the claims line before 1900 and found them most helpful.  arranged for an electrician to call the following morining to make wiring safe and a gas fitter also called over the weekend. On Monday Johnsons called to see about cleaning and a Loss Adjuster from Cuinningham Lindsey came on Tuiesday. We were then away for 2 weeks and on return recovery swung into place. Carpets curtains and soft covers were cleaned and all kitchen contents cleaned or condemned. We submitted two estimates to replace the entire kitchen and speedy approval was given. A couple of claims were settled quickly and the new kitchen was installed late November. We then submitted our final claim on 20 December but had no response from the Loss Adjusters despite 3 reminders until 5th March 2014 when they apologised for the delay and advised that the claim was approved. I received the cheque from  on 11 March. Apart from that delay all was v good.
18,"I had a leak from my bath that damaged the ceiling below. I claimed the loss adjuster visited and quickly agreed a value using my chosen builders quotes and gave me a cheque to do the work. Very simple quick stress free and easy. Also as we have artex on all of our ceilings he took samples as artex can include asbestos and had them checked and luckily we are asbestos free. We did not know but if our artex had asbestos we would have had to replace every ceiling as just happened for a friend of mine who is currently living in a hotel while all of his ceilings are removed due to artex with asbestos in it.
Great service as I now expect from  who are a quality insurer when you need to claim."
19,After the recent storms we suffered damage to our roof.  dealt with our claim with fairness and speed. So glad we our with a proper insurance company.
20,after the radiator upstairs burst and caused the ceiling in the room below to fall down  were wonderful because the ceiling was artexed they had to test for traces of asbestos.  took charge of everything the ceiling was tested and found to be positive. The ceiling was immediately sealed until the specialists could come and take down the ceiling and replace it and all the wallpaper. As this happened at Christmas I had to wait until it was convenient for all parties involved to be available.  kept me informed each step of the way phoning regularly also the assessor and other parties who were involved phoned to tell me the time they would be coming and what day everyone was polite and helpful and cleared up all mess (and when the ceiling came down there was an awful lot of mess). The room looked wonderful when it was finished and you could not tell anything had happened. Thank you  I will certainly recommend you to others.
21,I lost an expensive piece of jewellery whilst on holiday and contacted  on my return. The adviser was patient and supportive and guided me though the claims process which was hassle free with a swift resolution. I cannot speak too highly of the service received and I would not hesitate to recommend  to others.
22,reminder came by post quotation on line which was easy to alter to my requirements
23,"When I contacted  to report that we had a water leakthey acted very quickly got the engineer to stop the leak.
But when it came to deal with the repair of the ceiling it took over 6 weeks to settle the claim.
They sent out a surveyor and he told me that they can to the repairs cheaper but would only repair the damaged part of the ceiling and as we have a through lounge the ceiling would look very odd one part covered with ceiling tiles and the other side not. So was not very impressed and when after two weeks I hadnt heard anything from them I contacted them and was told that as the surveyor had been out he would be dealing with all the clame and to contact him that was not what I was accepting when I then told them he had not even given me any contact details all he was concerned about was that I did not have a matching item policy and said that all he was going to do. As far as I am concerned the ceiling is part of the building not a item like furniture."
24,I found the staff were really helpful everything was explained clearly and prices were fantastic also policy comes with other benefits highly recommend to any 1 wish I had of tried these before I had been with my other insurer for a couple of year never mind
25,very happy with the price for the value of money i get
26,Our roof and chimney were damaged in the Christmas New Year storms. A viva have been excellent in many ways but due to so many people being affected it was very difficult talking to the person overseeing the claim. Emailing was the only way to have contact with this person. With perseverance on our behalf it was sorted and paid out taking approx 10 weeks in total.
27,From getting a qote on line and setting up the policy was a positive experience. Great customer service in setting up. Everthing they said they would do they did. Also very reasonable price giving me a saving. Highly reccomended
28,"Considering the problems of flooding at this time  my claim was dealt with quite quickly .
Any request that I had re company to be used for my repairs were agreed ."
29,Why oh why do you make us use premium telephone numbers when we have to contact you ?
30, seemed to be one of the only major companies which made it easy to buy contents only insurance - they offered a cost effective option that was easy to purchase online
31,I was looking for a competitive quote as my previous insurer had ratcheted up the rate again this year. Having recently insured my cars with  I was offered a discount to switch my home insurance. I wasnt sure it would be competitive as we live close to a flood zone however they significantly beat the renewal quote with as much or more cover. Very pleased.
32,straight forward questions that can easily be understood  and the telephone staff are extremely helpful and experienced if you need any help with the application form.
33,My previous insurance had gone up year upon year and my neighbours suggested changing companies. Having been with  for my car insurance for years I contacted them. From the moment I was connected to an extremely personable and knowledgeable advisor to the final agreement on a policy was a pleasure. I am extremely pleased with both the price and the service and I would unhesitatingly recommend .
34,This was by far the easiest claim I have ever made. From first phone call to settlement at end of claim took only 2 weeks.
35,REALLY EASY DID ALMOST ALL OVER PHONE AND VERY UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE ON PHONE
36,Never had a fire or claimed insurance payment in over 50 years before this claim. I was pleasantly surprised that everything was replaced like for like and very efficiently. I could have claimed for replacement of some items which were really not necessary to be replaced but like to be fair.
37,On a Like for Like basis the  product was more competitively priced than my renewal quotation.
38,Entirely unimpressed with the  claim process that is clearly not fit for purpose.
39,Very quick and easy to set up. I had to tel to set up and service was excellent. Made a large saving but the ease of dealing with a UK call centre was the real bonus particularly as they didnt try to hard sell lots of other insurances.
40,Had a flooded kitchen and contacted the claim centre. The claim was processed promptly and surveyors and contractors sorted the claim from start to finish (finish being when we were satisfied all works were completed). Works came with a guarantee. The claims team kept in contact to ensure everything was done. No stress. Done in a very timely fashion. Very happy. Well done.
41,The quote from my previous insurer had rocketed and  was the first option I looked at. It all looked so good and simple I just went for it.
42,"1st time insured with a viva.
Good thing noticed Thad like car insurance you can Protect no claim bonus"
43,Great deal would have a look well worth it you will be happy you did I was.
44,"There is no doubt that  has revolutionised the way in which we now buy our insurance!
No longer is it the challenging experience that we all dreaded facing.
 has made purchasing insurance so simple in a language that is easily understood presented in a really friendly and courteous manner. I have just purchased my Home Contents Insurance policy from  with considerable financial savings and increased benefits So I am very pleased!
As I had already transferred my Financial Investment Plans to  last year on the advice of my Financial Adviser I was already well impressed by s performance and service. I already have my car insurance lined up for  on renewal. And by moving my insurances under one roof I can now get all the benefits of My with all my policies readily available on line!
VIVA !"
45,I went online to get a quote from various companies and as I had my car insurance with  I tried them. the quote was very favourable but there were a couple of questions I neededto resolve. The main one was the quote was far better priced than any other so I rang the Freephone no. the next morning. The agent not only resolved my queries but went through the complete form explaining what each section did for me. Excellent service.
46,Fast and easy access to the web site and I have secured that deal that I wanted that is right for me I just hope that I get the same next year when it is time to renew my policy.
47,My claim was dealt with quickly and efficiently. An assessor came within a few days and the voucher came through shortly after that. Everyone I dealt with was polite and helpful.
48,E-mail and telephone response to my claim was polite professional and efficient. First class service.
49,when i called  it was the best call id made for insurance EVER... i couldnt have been happier when i had finished my phone call. i was so impressed with the adviser and his professional experience in the insurance i wanted.to tell the whole world how wonderful i felt. .a big thank you to ..
50,"Initial response was decisive and informative. The external agencies survey drying out decorating handled efficiently. Coordination between building and contents
area of responsibilities was poorly explained and therefore caused confusion when trying to address issues. By and large happy with the overall outcome."
51,Bikes replaced with no fuss. Excellent prompt service.
52,We were entirely satisfied with the way  dealt with our recent claim. We are senior citizens and were making our first claim after a break in .  gave us every assistance and made the whole process much easier for us to deal with. We would certainly recommend them to others.
53,Efficient and courteous staff providing excellent services. Would recommend  to friends without hesitation.
54,"I requested quotes on line and after several changes
in cover made by myself I eventually accepted the one
that I was happy with. The application was very straightforward and  delivered my documents by
e mail which I was able to access and print at my
discretion. They make everything so easy and I would have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone who is
taking out insurance for the first time or like myself switching
insurance providers."
55,Excellent value same cover but half the price of my current insurance company. Very helfull customer service explains exactly what you are purchasing and cover needed.
56,Very courteous and efficient customer servicevery competitive pric and I also have car insurance with the company.
57,In general extremely helpful. A few times I had to call to check what was happening but someone did get back to me. The experience wasnt stressful at all.
58,"straightforward options throughout setting up procedure
clear instructions and very competitive rate"
59,The home insurance was purchased over the phone as I had to add a specific item to my policy. My query was dealt with quickly efficiently and in a friendly manner. I have no complaints.
60,"After browsing with an insurance comparison website I found  which surprised me as it was the first well-known company that appeared on these websites. After asking for a quote on ï¿½s website this turned out to be even lower than the original one I was given. I needed a very basic insurance for my tenancy and I have to say Iï¿½m glad to be paying as little as I am compared to other well-known insurance companies and I was also glad to see that I might get a discount next year if I have no claims and another one for signing up online.
In the end  made it quite simple to sign up for something that I thought would require lots of time."
61,I was already with  for my car insurance but with just 1 phone call I managed to save a lot of money on our yearly bills by swapping my husbands car insurance and our buildings and contents insurance. The process was so easy and the person I spoke to was really friendly and made the process painless
62,Easy to talk with and listened to my queries. Explained in detail everything covered for my individual needs.
63,Very happy and satisfied with their online quote although it was not the cheapest but giving the reviews from other customers i chose . Not been with  before therefore i have no experience in dealing with them so far in terms of making a claim etc. Overall very happy with their services.
64,All done in an efficient manner. Web site was easy to follow and follow us call from a representative was helpful but not intrusive. Only negative is that I kept getting emails regarding the taking up of a quote after I had purchased the policy.
65,From first phone call to completion of damage was swift and secure. No hassle whatever. Thank you.
66,The promised incentive has not arrived. Feel like this is another insurance promise not fulfilled. What vouchers?
67,"Well explained in laymans terms.
More important my policy was well priced in relation to other quotes from other insurance companies.
I opted for the online option which was also very straightforward so would recommend  home insurance after my experience."
68,No problems with on line purchase. Product was well described and met my requirements in most ways. Much less expensive than using other methods of purchase.
69,I would like to thank all at  for the speed my claim was met with. The team showed agreat understaning of my problems and dealt with all maters in a very timely fashion. I will be pleased to reccomend  in the future.
70,Service was excel ant inisial phone call was fast and Ifishant and dealt with quikly .The accesare was very fair and delt with this matter in a very ifishant and the money was received in to our account with in the 7day period and I could not recommend the service enough
71,Time taken was appalling..  were trying to penny pinch at every stage which I guess actually cost them a lot more due to many un necessary repeat visits from workmen. Standard of work done was good and workmen very polite. Disappointing lack of any communication from Asprea. Not like the adverts. First claim I have ever made and I am extremely disappointed
72,Super fast & smooth claim processhighly recommended.
73,After years of re-negotiating with my previous supplier they would always drop the price to close to better quotes  gave a great saving with better cover. The ********* came close and admitted they could because my new quote they sent had a large profit ~ I left and gave the business to .
74,The quote I got from  was far cheaper than my original home insurance with a more extensive cover as well. It was simple to set up and hassle free definitely worth the 20 mins on the phone going through the policy.
75,Excellent help from claims team with no hassle and all questions answered
76,Be very careful i was passed from pillar to post for days on end. finally exactly what I feared has happened.  double charged me. Even though I was assured this would not happen.
77,"I phoned  and got a quote from a very polite customer adviser. I needed to insure my main home also a holiday home and on both quotes the price was just right.
Thank all your staff for their care and attention."
78,From the start of making my claim on my home insurance the claim was dealt with quickly and efficiently. The service received from  was excellent. I even had a phone call to make sure that they hadnt mislaid my final bill as they hadnt reimbursed me but I hadnt submitted it due to the repairs not being done due to the bad weather. I would definitely recommend  Home Insurance I couldnt have asked for a better claims experience! Thank you
79,Had a claim for a cabinet unit accidentally broken whilst decorating claim submitted and settled within 2 weeks money in my account staff etc could not be so helpful it was a pleasure and it is not many people can say that
80,Happy with policy but this was to replace cover elsewhere which did not expire for a further ten days . I do not recall seeing a page giving me the option to start my policy on a set date on application and not on purchase either. I rang  to be told they could cancel my policy and I could start again but they could not redate to coincide with other renewal. So rather than all the hassle I left dates as they were and  had two lots of cover for about 10 days - need to make this clearer or be more flexible to change start dates  even if it was their customers error in not seeing something in application process
81,First time buying from good help given through options on the telephone.
82,Only issue was Insured amount much higher than total assets in the property
83,Although we werent allowed our total claim put in by the builder we feel the amount offered was fair.  made the claim process easy and straight forward and I would certainly recommend them
84,Having filled everything online and submitting I realised i needed to change a few things. Customer services very quickly changed things to my satisfaction and issued a revised policy schedule.
85, was easy to access on line for a quote and when I phoned to purchase the policy I could not fault their service very efficient and helpful I also changed another insurance policy that was due for renewal as I was so pleased with their service. Would highly recommend
86,We already have our cars on a group insurance so decided to see if  could beat my home insurance renewal. They did!! Fantastic customer service and would highly recommend them.
87,"finally rewarded 10 more years no claims!
pretty quick response and kindly handled.
really bad mood from the damage has been changed
to somewhat pleasant one thanks to your service."
88,recently bought contents insurance online very easy to follow the form and love that you have the option to change excess add accidental damage and the fact that it increases your cover at holiday times. Have made a saving in the first year so very pleased. Clear and concise information given regarding cover at each step. Easy to print off all the forms and again all the information clear and transparent so you know exactly what you are covered for. Received a follow up call the same day to ensure I knew the key facts of the insurance cover and what the excess was. Great customer service and would definitely recommend  to friends. Follow the rules of selling insurance at each step of the way what more can you ask for.
89,"We submitted a claim as we had water pouring into the house bypassing window frames and getting into the cavity.
An Assessor visited the house saw the damage and gave us payment for repairs there and then. Brilliant!"
90,"Very easy website and good price quoted on line with extra discounts for buying both house and contents insurance together.
I would certainly recommend  for all types of insurances in fact I also found them to be the best for my car insurance."
91,This was set up by phone but because i was unable to purchase on line i still received the same discount and the rep. was exceptionally helpful.
92,It was a pleasure to get my house building insurance with  all terms explained and yes it save me lots of money  the gentleman on the phone so helpful and polite  would recommend this five star services to any one
93,easy to do on line documents came through very quick and best of all the price was very good been with previous company a while now but they could not offer the same at the start only a cash back 3months later but you want it when you are taking the policy out not later on. very pleased with this purchase I just hope its the same if you have to make a claim.
94,Very smooth transaction. Treated politely and speedily by customer Services. Couldnt fault the service.
95,Due to unique additional cover required on our policy both the agent on the phone and underwriter worked absolute miracles to not only arrange the extra cover but to arrange it at no extra cost to ourselves. Brilliant !!
96,Great customer service the first time Id attempted to do my insurance online very helpful when I needed to ring for advice!
97,efficient and easy to navigate to obtain a realistic quote
98,We needed contents insurance for a home we rent after using another company for 5 years. Normally we just renewed with them because it was easy and seemed to be affordable. Upon looking at our renewal in March we saw the premeium had gone up alot and yet we have made no claims ever
99,Had to make 2 claims in 2 months both times our claim was dealt with quickly sensibly and without fuss or quibble.
100,"Went to  as had positive prior experience with motor and property insurance. Policy features and Benefits rated as average as I have not had need to make a claim so I dont know what the real world  has to offer.
I bought my policies over the phone the sales staff were excellent and the whole process was easy and most importantly went at my pace. No pressure to buy afforded me the opportunity to really consider my insurance needs and make a decision I am happy with."
101,site easy to use good value for money would use again
102,We all experienced the bad weather. I had the minor problem of a chimney pot blowing off and my garage roof loosing some panels. Although the phone lines for non emergency calls was busy the online form was easy to fill in and I received a confirmation email with my claims number very quickly. They sent an assessor out and he okd my claim and agreed to let me use my own builders. Everything was easy and quick when considering how busy that period of time was the service was excellent. I would recommend  to anyone. I also have my car insurance with them best price by far!!!!!
103,Easy to access online. Value for money Cheapest quote I had found.
104,"Call centre staff were knowledgeable and very patient in explaining all the different options/additions available with the buildings and contents policy.
A particular clause was very carefully explained so that I fully understood how it affected the policy."
105,Very friendly staff and I saved by swapping to  Thankyou.
106,"Very easy to use and straight forward. Options help
create own needs and so suits all budgets. Great value."
107,After a quotation online and gaining quotes from other companies (do not believe in price comparison sites) I completed my online application and received posted confirmation days later. Great service and value for money
108,"I was with an alternative provider and went on the Go Compare website where I located . I called them and went through everything in fine detail and they gave me a great price and better cover on my Home Insurance cover.
The lady whom I spoke to was extremely helpful and went through every category with me in great detail. When my car and motor cycle insurance is due I will be transferring that to  as well."
109,nice and easy to use the  site on the internet. passed info on for two more people to sign up. great price.
110,Having enjoy a number of policy with  over the years pension endowment etc since last year car insurance now house cover  next will be my wife car insurance. I very much appreciate the easiest online website and the excellent follow up service. Well done.
111,I found them very easy to deal with and very helpful and had no trouble getting in touch
112,I wasnt impressed with the builders I was sent ended up stopping the plumber coming back and got my own ..cost me a lot more than they gave me for the repairs as plumber damaged tiles and bath trim ...wont be trusting anyone again ..they came recommended from the insurance .. the guys who stripped the wallpaper got water in my sockets so couldnt turn lights off and sparking .had to get a electrian out at night to change socket ..I wont be using these again ever .. was not impressed at all ..decorators were good only after they went did I see paint all over the kitchen cupboards and meter cupboard .plasterer had plaster all over my floor didnt sheet up and they wondered why I wasnt impressed
113,"The service was excellent and quick - 1 week before vouchers for replacement electronics were sent.
However could only use vouchers at Currys which has the highest prices on the high street - could have got the same replacement much cheaper elsewhere and saved  some money!"
114,I was very impressed with the service I recieved from  Staff.They explained my Policy which helped me to fully understand what I was paying for.Iam happy now I have what I needed at a fair price.Thank you
115,Easy intuitive online experience. Took 10 minutes. excellent value.
116,Fast easy and excellent value .The person I spoke to on the phone was both informative and efficient.
117,I found thet  were very helpful inmy claim did not hesitate in fullfilling my claim for a lost diamond from a gold ring
118,A great overall experience. It is has been very easy to navigate around the site and compare different levels of cover. And at a very competitive price also!!
119,why did i go for  simple they provided a good cover for bikes at a reasonable cost other companys had a low fixed cover - end of story with  you can chose the level for your most expensive bike we talked through the ifs and buts with the  rep. obiviously the usual due care to be taken but we are very happy with our cover. If like me finding good low cost cover for your pedals has been a big issue get a quotecheck out their policy wording and talk to the company about your needs to get reassured you really are covered at such a reasonable cost :)
120,Very helpful staff and good customer service. The issues were resolved very quickly.
121,It was so easy to arrange and when I had to call to get things changed for me - the call centre were helpful and chatty - a real pleasure to deal with. The price was GREAT too.
122,Cheapestand best cover value for value that ive been quoted for this year.
123,Phoned up for family landlords buildings insurance. Very professionally spoken to and found the cover very generous for the premium paid. Im looking forward to getting quotes off  when my policies held elsewhere are due for renewal as I now qualify for a discount.
124,A very traumatic time for myself and my family made a lot better by great customer service from my personnel claims manager very I pressed
125, provided an excellent timely and efficient claims service following the recent February storms. Following damage to our roof with a builders report photographs and a fair budget we were able to proceed and get the work done. We received payment within the week. Really good service thank you.
126,"Easy online form to fill in
Excellent online customer service Excellent customer service on the phone - value for money quite which I accepted - thank you-----"
127,The  experience was unexpectedly speedy smooth understanding and caring. Our break-in occurred whilst we were already with a family bereavement  made the whole hurtful experience a lot less painful. Memories cannot be replaced but  provided the sugar to take the medicine.
128,Friendly and professional service very helpful and polite.
129,A very simple and easy way to take out a policy at a good price
130,Price was great customer service was great made you feel at ease right from the start
131,Claim process was handled in a professional manner from start to finish. Valuation was fair although choice of jewellers available to source replacement was very limited. I was kept informed through each step of the process although my correspondence with  was not always acknowledged.
132,"Our claim was handled courteously and promptly. Arrangements were made quickly to have our back door made secure after being quite severely damaged during the break in.
We were kept informed of the progress of our claim and in fact an offer was made in just 7 days."
133,Left  last year as had another quote - much cheaper but this year other quote had doubled to much more than  quoted me so went back to 
134,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE ATTENTION OF THE PERSON IN THE CALL CENTRE THERE WAS A QUESTION I NEEDED TO ASK A REAL PERSON AFTER GETTING AN INITIAL QUOTE ON THE INTERNET. ALL WAS EXPLAINED IN SIMPLE CLEAR LANGUAGE WITHOUT LEAVING A FEELING OF NOT GETTING GOOD ADVICE. THERE WASNT A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE IN MY QUOTES BUT THE QUALITY OF COVER WAS FAR BETTER AND PRESENTED IN A CLEARER WAY.
135,Got a phone call from them saying you have car insurance with us can we quote yo on your house and contents I said yes and was very very please with the price for what they offered me.i said yes straight a way
136,Wind damage to roof. Rang and was told to organise repair and submit bill. Easy peasy (not sure what would have happened had we not had ï¿½900 to pay roofing firm presumably they would have had to wait for  to pay them).
137,I carried out my annual review of suppliers and found that  was the most cost effective (i do not mean the cheapest) and decided to go with them. The price however was very competitive and the process was easy online.
138,very good customer service  I appreciated the concern and prompt attention your telephone operators gave me and the prompt return to my e maill enquries. I would have no hestiation in recommending  to anyone. My experience from start to finish was excellent Obviously I was in great distress over the damage caused by the storm and cannot speak highly enough of the attention the staff at  gave me
139,Went onto one of the price comparison websites to get a quote for buildings and contents insurance and was fairly pleased with the results but the best quotes were from lesser known companies and the cover was not as comprehensive as I would have liked. My daughter recommended  so I applied online and was very pleased with the ease of the application and the fact that I didnt have to fill in pages of information before getting the quote which was very reasonable. A customer services representative followed up with a phone call to check that I was happy with the quote.
140,The service was dreadful from start to finish. After waiting several weeks for a response regarding a broken toilet I complained and was then fobbed off with an offer of money which is not what we wanted. We then managed to find a plumber ourselves who fixed the toilet for a fraction of the amount offered. Company was not interested in helping us so we feel like weve paid for nothing. Will not be renewing our policy or recommending  to anyone else.
141,"After obtaining a quote on the internet I had plenty of time to think it over and compare before making up my mind.
A courtesy call from  sealed the deal"
142,Staff at  were understanding and sympathetic when dealing with our claim relating to a burglary. The staff were calm non-judgemental and fortunately were able to replace the equipment taken from the premises.

I would certainly recommend them as a company and a big thank-you to their staff on the front line.
143,The initial contact and service was good but the follow-up needs improvement as I did not receive the information i requested. I had to chase and was told that the information had been missed off or forgotten from the quote.

145,Great handling of claim however very disappointed at excessive increase in renewal premium in view of relatively small non accidental claim (storm). First claim ever!

149,"After telephoning to report water damage after a storm I had to phone to remind the surveyor to get in touch with me. This could be improved.
After the survey I had to phone again to get the report. He wanted us to accept the offer before we had a chance to get quotes for the work.
This needs to be improved.
Everyone we spoke to was very polite and helpful. Well done."
150,It was useful to be able to input different scenario to select amount of cover needed and to save quotes to make a comparison before deciding on level I wanted. I found them competitive and cheaper for similar cover compared with the existing cover I already had. It was useful to be able to speak to an adviser on the phone when I needed to clarify a point.
151,The winter storms caused damage destroying my greenhouse and collapsing a garden wall. My claim was dealt with speedily with an instant off to cover both items. When I had submitted the invoices for the replacement greenhouse and the rebuilding of the wall they were met without any problem and cheques despatched. My conversations on the telephone were dealt with civily and with no hassle.
152,We had a leaking roof which came through into our living room due to the floods we experience earlier on this year.  were brilliant it was easy and not stressful in the slightest. Customer Services were friendly and were keen to sort out the claim without any hiccups. With 2 Daughters in the home it was a relief to know  were on the ball and as keen as us to sort the problem.

I checked the  website and saw that there was a simple form to complete a few photos and send off. Simple! I was contacted a day or two later and asked a few more questions - then told to get a quote and if less than ï¿½1500 get it fixed.
The following week more tiles off the houses roof and some damaged part of the conservatory roof. Again the same quick response - this time just by sending photos to the person dealing with the first claim.

I have now replaced the lost item and am totally satisfied with .
192,I have recently purchased  travel insurance and found this an easy and pleasant experience so when it was time to review my existing house insurance I had little difficulty in choosing . I checked price comparisons and  came out as one of the best values. Actually buying the insurance was made easy by the person I spoke to who guided me through the form. I suppose that the whole exercise took only about fifteen minutes. I didnt have to list to the Four Seasons as I got through to real person quickly. Equally satisfactory was the fact that I got a reduction because I already had health and travel insurance with . As I have not yet claimed on my  policy I have no comment to make on that aspect but I have every confidence that all will go well.
193,This is the first time making a claim through  and from beginning to end went very smoothly. Couldnt have asked for more.
194,I used  last year and when the renewal came through I decided to do my homework and look for a better quote using a well known search engine.....I got a better price....but as I was so pleased with the previous experience with  I decided to call them back and see if they could match or even beat the quotes I had.

I was asked to take some photos and get a quote this I did and emailed to them within 2 days I was given the authority to go ahead. This I did and had the repairs done to my flooded floor. I submitted the invoice and within 2 weeks the claim was paid directly into my bank and resolved!! Wow highly recommended
197,Website was so easy to use & got a fantastic quote in no time at all. Price was much cheaper than my renewal quote & received an extra discount because I have my car insurance with  also.
198,The storm of December 2013 caused water ingress to my house. When I contacted  they were efficient and understanding of my claim.

210,"We had the misfortune to have a toilet cistern crack resulting a ceiling coming down us. Avivia did eventually deal with our claim but it took us chasing them. THE CALL CENTRE REP THOUGHT IT ACCEPTABLE TO LIVE WITH A BUCKET UNDER THE CEILING TO CATCH WATER DURING FLUSHING THEN TURN OFF THE WATER TILL NEEDED AGAIN.
Emails two of went unanswered call centre at times gave wrong advice Eventually Perth office sorted us out and work to fix us up was started the cheque arrived two days later To be fair to Avivia the company had to deal with the serious flooding in England so overall We are happy with the service we received."
211,Cant fault the help or service what more could you ask for they were there when I needed them. JOB WELL DONE.
212,"very slow to assesss claim.
very expensive method of assessment.
person claiming to be my \personal contact throughout the process\ never again available! poor resolution. resolved without insurance assistance quickly and cheaply after giving up!"
213,EXCELLENT SERVICE CAN NOT FAULT ANYTHING WOULD RECOMMEND IT
214,I saved money by checking with  after visiting a comparison website. The whole process took minutes and was very easy to arrange.
215,After a water leak coming through our kitchen ceiling we locatedwhere it was coming from - under the bath.unfortunately I had fitted reinforced  tiled panelling to the front of th bath. When removinthe said tiled ledge and panel I discovered that I had made too good a job of fixing the panel and in the removing of the unit I broke the bath - irrepairably. I contacted  and explained the problem. They moved swiftly and arranged a surveyor to call. He me the appointed date and arranged an agreeeable sum for the repair /replacement of the bath and for fixing the ceiling. The settlement monney was in my account swiftly and thworks have been completed. Prior to my becoming a semi retired barberI ran a successful bathroom renovation and replacement businessand quite a number of my clients were stonewalld and had horror stories to tell about how they had been messed about by their insurers...This didnot happen to me I obviously chose to deal with a more caring company.
216,"I recently had some storm damage to my house and had to make a claim I couldnt believe how easy it was to make the claim and how helpfull the claim person was. I had the work done and they settled my payment within days.
Excellent service"
217,Straight forward professional service. Does exactly what it says on the tin*sorry ronseal
218,A good on line experience not so good when I had a question with an advisor
219,Unfortunatly I had 2 claims during last 4 years but I was lucky to be insured with . The claim department react and worked very well. My family did not have any problem during the job was curried on. I did not feeled abandoned with my problem.
220,"I t was easy to renewal the policy. My questions were answered to my satisfaction by cunstomer services. The policy content is very good and compares very well with what the insurance market offers and is very good value for money.
I would like to see the 5 years Non claim discount reviewed each year so that it increases with time if no claim is made."
221,Decided to look at my house insurance costs and found  to be significantly cheaper than old insurance company for exactly the same cover.
222,"The service was excellent
the fishing rods were replaced quickly and all my other fishing tackle was also replaced quickly I would recommend  great customer service"
223,Excellent website easy to use not too many intrusive questions. Does not take long to place your order. Very competitive price compared to my old insurer. Strongly recommended!
224,I received a quote from my previous home insurance provider and was unhappy with the price. So as I have my car insured with I decided to ask for a quote. What a surprise similar cover was far cheaperI need say no more.I fully recommend .
225,expected this to be a long drawn out affair. it wasnt. great service. well done.
226,I made a house insurance claim when my roof was damaged recently. The claim was approved quickly once I had sent in pictures etc. But due to the advisor getting one number of my bank account wrong the money didnt go through when they said it would. So I had to pay the roofer ï¿½680 cash (that I didnt have) and wait for the money to arrive in my account. That said everything else was fine.
227,Quick effective service. One phone and 3 email and cash in the bank.
228,was very easy to purchase online. simple forms to use and navigate.
229,As I have only just purchased this policy I cannot give a detailed review as yet. The on-line service was fast & easy & much cheaper than my old company who raised the cost for no good reason to almost double what it was last year. I hope that should I have reason to claim that I will find that I am comprehensively covered & without any hidden clauses which will prevent me from being able to claim fully. I have not received my documents yet which is a concern.
230,We personally found  to be very professional and fantastic value for car and home insurance we would recommend them with out hesitation
231,Competitively priced and good reputation. Good service to date
232,"Christmas Eve storm blew a tree down and took out part of the fence was confused that as the tree landed next door was not covered onor removal of the stump from property but fence panels damaged were.
Once we had got our heads rounf this conception our claim was dealt with very quickly and easily.
Not a bad experience of an Insurance Company."
233,Have recently changed to  and was grateful for the assistance/patience in setting up a policy to suit my needs. As this is the first point of contact the right impression has been set.
234,"AS a satisfied  Motor Insurance client when my Home Insurance came up for renewal at increased terms I thought I would try  Online. Their site was easy to navigate and the option choices were good and easy to understand.
The terms quoted and the over available were better than my expiring insurers"
235,"Excellent service. When I needed advice on home and contents ins.  could not have been better. Advised me on best option. Once first premium was paid on applying that was me covered.
Gave peace of mind as my old ins had lapsed and they would not re instate. The staff are so friendly. Thank you"
236,"I firstly went through my requirements on the internet and with a good range of products to match my needs I obtained a quote online with a quote reference which I could retrieve when required.
I found this more useful than making my mind up there and then giving me time to add or deduct items to the policy.
When ready I rang  and wastalked thru the policy with one of their adviserswho was very helpful giving advice and explaining any clauses or items I did not understand.
After placing my order I wasgiven the choice of online or paper documents and as having problems with my computer at that time I went for paper documents which arrived by post very quickly.
The service was very good from start to finish should I have to claim on my policy I hope the service is just as good."
237,Even with all the add ons weve made a significant saving from our home insurance with another company last year. We now have all our insurance cover with  which means we get even better deals.

239,Very easy online quote system simple to customise cover to your own personal / family requirements simple to purchase what more could you wish for.
240,I changed insurer this year  offered a great price and also a comprehensive home insurance policy. It cost me no extra to protect my no claims and increase the value of items taken out of our home.
241,"I made enquiry for insurance and was given enough time to run through their question for getting a quote. I was left with a quite and was told that they will ring after 3 weeks which they did. I made a few changes from the first cover and that was adjusted immediately and I accepted the revised quote. I received my cover details immediately by email.
I now have full cover to my satisfaction."
242,Part of my roof was blown off during the recent storms I emailed photographs and within the hour was told to get a quote and email it to them. A week later I emailed the quote and within 10 minutes it was accepted and payment settled. I would recommend  to anyone looking for insurance as I am really satisfied with the service I received.
243,The staff I spoke to were brilliant knowledgeable and helpful and fully explained the product and answer my queries. There was one big downside I had originally got a quote using the internet but I had a couple of queries and I was told that once I spoke to a member of staff and they accessed the on line quote I would only be able to deal with the call centre and would not be able to view the quote on line or amend it. Rather an odd situation for the 21st Century My motor policy quote ect did not work this way so why does home insurance?
244,It was easy to compare what cover/policy i needed very easy to purchase..
245,Whilst renewing my annual building and contents insurance I was disappointed that my long term insurer had increased my premium by 17 percent and they were unwilling to review against better value quotes. After seeking several online quotes  offered excellent cover levels at a very competitive price. As a well known reputable company I chose to proceed and secured cover through a very simple and straightforward process.
246,I was very impressed with the overall experience in searching for and receiving information about home insurance. the information was easy to read and I particularly liked the query bits where is was easy to review the purchase and check whether that part of the service was necessary before proceeding.
247,Superb ease online during quote search. competitively priced and superb products provided.
248,Normally when requesting insurance you alway get the feeling that they are out to make money. However  were helpful and saved me money. Without prompting the telesales person said \ I see that you have life insurance with us pounds\. So when my house insurance was due  they match my quote more as I got the M&S vouchers as well.
249,Phone call was to the point questions answered efficient service
250,Whilst comparison websites can be helpful the results do not always compare like with like. Whilst  might not initially appear in the top five a more detailed analysis showed them far more competitive against other companies some I had never even heard of! The ease and clarity of their website was very good as was the response from the telephone helpline. When it came to a decision  were streets ahead on value policy features and reputation.
251,Excellent customer service product knowledge was what I would have expected from  thats why I have given a 5 star rating. Prices fairly competitive but they do offer that little bit more.
252,I got both a personal claim handler at  and a third party company. Initially I was concerned about the duplication. Finally the on-the-ball  claim handler settled everything a few steps ahead of the third party it has to be said.  returned calls quickly and processed the claim based on many photos of the storm damage.
253,I received a letter from  inviting me to obtain a quote for my home and contents insurance. It didnt take too long for the very friendly and efficient salesperson to get my enquiry completed and I was not hassled to sign up there and then - something that has happened in the past with other companies. I received exceptional service.
254,Not a long rewiew as  didnt take long to sort out my claim  very happy  thanks
255,I have recently purchased home insurance which was easy to do online. The cover is good and reasonably priced. I had motor and business insurance with  and will certainly consider  for my motor cycle.
256,The phone call and subsequent communication were pretty good everything seems clear and appeared to be explained well.
257,The call handler was professional he went through all options available in both contents and building insurance. They spoke perfect english and was clear and easy to understand which enables good communication.
258,We recently moved house unfortunately when unpacking our TV we damaged the screen. I phoned  at Lunch time and by 6.30pm the claim was settled.

262,It was so easy to deal with  the person who called me was very helpful and answered any questions I had. After the call I went back on line and completed my Home Insurance purchase. The whole process was painless . Will be looking to  next time my car insurance is up for renewal.
263,Didnt think I could get such a great deal with any of the big name insurance companies but  proved me wrong and I am extremely pleased with the price and what my policy offers. This is my first time buying contents insurance as I have moved away from my parents and if everything was as easy then I wouldnt want to run back home to mum! Thank you .
264,"This is I believe to be the best insurance I have ever taken out. The best car and home contents and the cheapest I have known.I used the internet to find better insurance and couldnt.
To say that i am very satisfied would be an understatement."
265,Everything wads managed over th telephone with sped and understanding. An easy and reassuring process for a reasonably large claim. Repairs organised by  with no questions for me.
266,The Internet site was simple to complete. The only drawback is that each amendment  whilst considering whether to commit two months before the renewal date generates an automatic follow-up. I therefore received three \reminder\ e-mails every day after my initial contact  but it was a very good offer!
267,from the first call to claim for ridge tiles blown off in the gales and broken tiles to completion of works this was a fast hassle free experience.The assessor who arrived the next day was understanding efficient informative and rushed his report through to get the claim up & running as soon as possible. I was kept informed of the process at all times by a friendly claims manager who arranged the builders etc to do the work. I was contacted by the builders who let me know when the scaffolders were arriving and also when they would be doing the work. The builders arrived on time and worked quickly to get all the repairs done with minimum fuss. They then arranged for the scaffolding to be removed quickly after theyd finished. The claims manager then gave me a courtesy call to check that all works were done to my satisfaction and that I was happy with the appointed builders and also said that I could call him any time if there were any ongoing problems with the repairs.
268,"What can I say. are brillant no problems what so ever.quick and very good responce to my on line/phone calls.Staff are very help full and help you out wthen you are not sure about some thing.
And of cause were brilliant with their quotes could not beat them.

270,Following storm damage resulting in flooding we everything was taken care of with one phone call. Reassuring and hassle free. Fantastic!
271,I would recommend  they delt with my claim very quickly and their claim handlers were very helpful
272,I had a live session with a member of the  team who answered every query that I had. I first used  for insurance last year for the two vehicles I have. Then they were very helpful and very competitive and have carried this on with the contents insurance. I would recommend  to anyone.
273,The on-line service was excellent. Everything was easy to find and clearly explained. Just when I was going to ask a question there was a pop up saying Al was available to chat on line and answer any questions. Perfect! They answered my query quickly and I could proceed to payment all at once. I could tell the customer was really important to  the whole way through and I feel like I am in safe hands.
274,Brilliant Deals and the best place I found for value for money
275,Easy system to use. On-line assistance good as is the telephone assistance. Good price Good cover given.
276,Had home insurance for many years. Decided to try  via website. House and contents overall cost well below renewal from existing insurer that last year was competitive. Had a couple of questions that were answered via chat line. Had no hesitation switching to . A very simple process from start to finish.
277,I love the service offered by  Insurance I have personal accident bronze cover I also have Home insurance now great. Last year I also use the travel insurance. I had a quick quote for motor insurance maybe it suits me. Love the customer service great to see good insurance.
278,I am very happy with  my last insurance company were not very helpful they were reluctant to give advice and charged me more money.
279,Ive shopped around before contacting  and nothing compared I was well pleased with price for my building and contents insurance also the service.
280,A good overall experience. I am satisfied with the claim experience because it was carried out efficiently and with no fuss and no delay. I would not hesitate to recommend  to a friend. The Assessor was very helpful and polite and the work that needed to be carried out was done without delay and very efficiently.. The claim was settled very fairly and quickly.
281,Excellent service and easy to use web site. initial quote was comparable to other companies but as I have other insurances with  the choice was simple.
282,"Had a policy renewal from an insurer Id been with for years which I thought was excessive called  and had to ask them if they had made a mistake on the first quote it seemed too cheap....

284,Excellent value for moneyeasy to use on line form.
285,Had car insurance with  and contacted them when home contents insurance was due for renewal. Found very helpful and process was easy with a cost saving that made my like for like policy worthwhile changing to. However when the policy came through I noticed that my bungalow was noted as 3 bedroomed not 2. Followed up to correct the error and in doing so it was also noted that I was down as a home owner not a tenant. Further conversation noted that I didnt have enough cover for my bicycle. All was quickly rectified but as a particular note it is really important to read the policy documents to ensure that they are correct. Not something Id say am always best at. Made me realise that I may have become unstuck had I needed to make a claim in the future. Would still recommend. Good value and excellent service.
286,It was a classic scenario
287,As a shareholder I was surprised how cheap the policy was to buy considering how well the company is doing. I found that a motor policy is more expensive than the renewal of my existing policy. I also persuaded my daughter to take out a home policy which was a lot cheaper than her existing one.
288,"We were previously with another home insurance provider however we have our 2 cars covered on  multi car insurance cover and decided to get a quote from .
We were taken by surprise at the savings we made for like for like cover and found the customer service easy to deal with. We would certainly recommend  to all of our friends and family."
289,Good price for standard cover no fuss easy purchase.
290,Helpful and good friendly response to the initial enquiry Rapid settlement. and all achieved on the phone with no form filling.
291,very good and very easy claim process and was dealt with very quickly.
292,the building staff were very professional and nice they took time not to make any more mess covered every thing up was well impressed
293,"Good level of cover for a very good price.
Professional customer service sensible competitive price.
Would recommend to a friend"
294,I needed help and advice whilst booking my insurance which was quite bespoke. The help and advice given was excellent with the staff obviously well informed in their work. I was given excellent advice by phone and email and all was checked with the underwriter to confirm as well. I was even given details of who should be spoken to if the person dealing was absent. In the modern age of badly informed call centres the experience was even more exceptional which is why I have stayed with the company for 10+ years - keep it up please!
295,"The online site was very easy to use and uncomplicated. Then I spoke to a member of staff who was equally helpful. The quote was competitive and everything was done and dusted in record time.
Id have no hesitation in recommending ."
296,I was very impressed by the staff at . The company used (Evander) were less impressive but did get the job done.
297,The assessor visited our house very quickly and was very helpful in suggesting the best way forward on repairs. I found him to be very fair and when emailed the quotes he approved them by email the same day and the cheque arrived the next day.
298,Wall blew down in storms in October and claim was sorted by  and their surveyors Asprea quickly.
299,Customer service was efficient but considering initial cost outlay and age of laptop disappointed with the settlement figure. This was much less than half the original cost of the15 month old high spec quality device accidentally damaged .
300,Insured the car last year so this year insured the house Great price good cover excellent telephone manner by the customer service team two years in a row
301,Very happy with my home and car insurance. Excellent customer service everything explained clearly. Also big savings on my previous insurers. It is also so satisfying to get through promptly when phoning and not to be left hanging on for ever. Best move I have made switching to .
302,excellent service allround.i know have my vehicle insurance with them.and will be looking to insure my wifes car when it is due.the quotes i received where very competitive compared to other companies.i have had my vehicle insured with them for afew years........
303,I work long hours and I can not have a phone at my place of work so I dont take it I contacted them by email and Im glad I did as I had proof of what they told me. It is all settled now as I put a complaint in and it was settled
304,staff were very helpful and polite making sure you are getting the right quotes.
305,Easy clear and helpful transaction over the phone knowledgeable response and stress-free service. Very quick and practical solution brilliant value for money. Pleasant cheerful communication and rapid hard copy response.
306,"I was looking to renew my building and contents policy with a new provider so i decided to go on line and see what the the comparison web sites had to offer. I checked a lot of different suppliers before i settled with the one that I thought was right for me.....
Its not the cheapest nor is it the dearest but it offered all that we needed with the benefit of a no claim protection option which I think is unusual in the industry.
I think the bottom line for us is that we want to be with a company that if something does go wrong they will fix it."
307,Ive been with the same company for many years now and was amazed at the saving Ive made by switching yet still retaining at least the same cover. Couldnt have taken more that fifteen minutes from start to finish.
308,Great service. Understood need for keeping things simple and getting the job done. Thank you!
309,I am also a great believer in keeping business local. I try and use local service rather than buying on line. However I like to get a deal and I found  who have a place in Perth my residence was offering a deal. So I bought!
310,The website gives a great choice and is easy to navigate. Good value and very helpful customer service.
311,"After searching various companys for home and contents I liked the easy approach on s web site. The price wasnt the cheapest I had found but the cover and the ability to change my voluntary excess swung it for me.....
It also helps that if you have one policy with  you get a percentage off on the next one you uptake out!"
312,Getting a quote on line is easy and allows you to compare prices but misses the human contact especially when you are interested in the policy. Staff member who contacted me was very helpful professional and knowledgable about the product she made the difference in me proceeding with the policy.
313,I found the service and attention to detail very good.
314,was pleasantly surprised what value for money I have got will not use compare sites again as these was the best
315,Excellent service on the website and over the phone very pleased.
316,Good telephone manner very patiient questions asked were easy to answer no pressure
317,Initially the telephone call was quite long but once that was completed my claim was dealt with very quickly and efficiently.
318,"A true account cannot be provided it is only when unfortunate circumstances happen and a claim has to be submitted. Only then can you measure a companies true service to their customers.
Setting up the policy is always easy for the companies want to portrait a professional image. The reason I changed companies is because a huge supermarket chain did not provide the service as and when required. Diligently I paid my
fees never making a claim over many years. Only to find that they would rescind on the contract with lame excuses even though I paid extra for their top cover.
So far Arriva has delivered with the policy for whilst I wss experiencing problems completeing online a company representative telephoned me and together the proforma was completed to my exacting standards.
Hope I never have to test their customer service levels during a claim but will now look at other responses to whether I should renew in the future."
319,I had my first claim in 53 years and I found  extremely helpful and they helped me process the work quickly and effectively
320,Gave me everything I asked for and an additional discount
321,Important features for us were unlimited rebuild costs and up to 80 thousand pounds rental payments should we have to move out.
322,"Having looked at one of the comparison sites for a good buildings insuranceI then looked at . I was pleasently suprised as I was offered a better cover and a better price.My buildings insurance is for a 3 bed house I let to a family member and I did not need contents at this time.
I will be looking at  for all my insurance needs in the future as I like what they offer and the site is so easy to use even for me."
323,I had a quote online and was so surprised with the price so saved and left. That night a gentlemen phoned with regards to the quote he went through everything and the price online was correct. Took the policy instantly.
324,The person who dealt with me and helped me had local knowledge. I think a friendly exchange makes a difference when dealing on the telephone.
325,Just to say thanks for all your help and im so glad i came to you for my home insurance i was given a qoute from my insurance company and went online to see if i could get a better deal i spoke to anviva and told them i would like to look around. after looking around and found some a little cheaper i went back to  and took out my insurance with them because i felt they give me a better service and and more protection than anybody else and overall the cost was not much more than i was paying elsewere. the contact service from start to finish was first class and the information given was easy and clear to understand just what i wanted and needed nothing fancy just plain and simple and the right amount of cover for me.
326,I am glad I renewed my home insurance with  I could not have been treated better with my claim Thank you to all the staff at  who settled my claim very quickly
327,Great service great product great price would definately recommend.
328,policy and benefits looks a good deal  the test will be if a claim is made (hopefully not!)!
329,So easy and quick and a discount for doing it online and for having car insurance with them.would recommend anyone to get a quote
330,Got a quote on line decided to think it over had decided to go with  and they rang me so they were very helpful and I went with them. My car is also insured with . A very good experience overall.
331,I have been with another insurance company for years and noticed the cost rising each year. I decided to try  who I also have my car insurance with and made an amazing saving! It was almost too simple to set it all up and I ended up ringing the office to check that it had gone through - it had! The chap in customer services seemed a little frustrated with me when I questioned why I was still getting quotes after I had purchased the insurance. However this was a small niggle balanced against the excellent saving every month. Highly recommended!
332,Very helpful staff at customer servicesDelt efficiently and quickly with my roof repairs.Would recommend  purley on standard of service
333,I had car insurance with  and was unfortunate enough to crash and write off my car. My claim was dealt with swiftly professionally and with no hassles or attempting to not pay or not pay a decent amount. In fact they gave me more than I expected! Naturally I renewed my car insurance with them and when it came time for my home insurance renewal I came straight to  knowing that they conduct themselves to a standard that the rest of the insurance industry is woefully below. Very happy with the price which was competitive with their rivals but why gamble on a cheaper alternative when the one you have is trustworthy and reliable?
334,EXCELLENT SERVICE from start to finish the claim was all sort out in less than one week highly recommended 5 STAR ******
335,A very good easy to purchase policy just what I was looking for.
336,I have house policys with  & when I required another the procedure could not have been easier. On line was not working so a free phone number came up the staff member quickly confirmed my existing policies gave me a quote for my new one including discount for multiple policies I paid and was happy to do so. The proof of the policy is only tested when making a claim but the way I was dealt with when purchasing gives me confidence that  is a professional outfit able to deal well with any needs. Thankyou.
337,Ive brought my home insurance but not received any letters about it.... Not good
338,I compared many different insurance companies before settling on . They were not necessarily the cheapest but covered everything that I thought was important with a reasonable excess. I am happy with my decision and have peace of mind because I know my home contents are insured in case of loss or theft.
339,Due to high winds my chimney had shifted. I called  who gave me the go ahead straight away to get the chimney braced and an email address to send the quote to. I did this then got the work done and emailed the invoice. I then got a call from a very nice man who asked how I wanted the money paid. Everything was dealt with over the phone and internet couldnt have been easier. Ive never claimed before but the service was exceptional and to top it all UK based personnel assisted me.
340,Delighted to speak to a helpful advisor in a Scottish service centre. Cover was as good as elsewhere and price was competitive.
341,In October 2013 our rear wall was damaged during the storm. We received 2 quotes the lowest being just under ï¿½4k. A surveyor came out and said to me that had I hit the wall with a sledge hammer then I would be looking at a better payout for accidental damage rather than storm damage. We have so far received an offer from  for ï¿½280 as a full settlement! Our garden has now been left exposed and is obviously a security risk as we try and save some money to have the wall rebuilt. The wall is also a health and safety risk as it is dangerously unsafe and people use the pathway behind. We have not accepted the offer given by . On a plus point the  call centre was very helpful.
342,My recent experience has left me in no doubt where I am going to place most if not all my insurance in the future.
343,Perchase home insurance was very easy through  and cheaper than my previously company the form is easy and simple to fill in on the website. Good value very pleased with the saving .Thank you

One week from beginning to end---what a wonderfully uncomplicated experience!!!!!

370,"I already hold my car insurance with  so decided to approach them regarding my Home Insurance after having received my renewal notice from my present company showing a premium which was far in excess of the year before and I had not claimed at all during that year nor the previous two years. The  person I spoke to was so helpful and the quote was far less than my previous years
premium with equal cover and benefits in the event of a claim. I was absolutely delighted. Well done ."
371,Web site rather slow - It took about four calls to an 0845 number to get the name on the policy corrected - I have my name on 3 policies with  - a name change was only required on one policy - their system could not cope it changed the name on the lot - what a fuss to get things sorted out.
372, made it easy for me to change from my long-established insurer - and offered a very competitive price!
373,so far I am very satisfied with the insurance offered and found it easy to access my policy
374,Claims dept. service was very good but was disappointed in quality of workmanship doing repair to woodwork. This was a claim made by my factor also with

379,Following storm damage I got one quote for the repair to be made rang  and gave them the details of my claim with the phone call lasting about 25 minutes. They said to go ahead with the work and email my paid invoice and photos of the damage. This was sent and I was notified two days later that a cheque had been issued. The whole process was very easy.

The advisors I spoke to were all very helpful and apologetic about my emails being unanswered. My claim was over Christmas so I know  had lots of claims to sort out with skeleton staff. It only took about 3 weeks from when I first claimed to be paid out and the work is now finished on my house - so overall very satisfactory.

394,In the run up to my renewal date I was contacted by five different insurance companies looking for my business. In the end I chose  because they were very helpful and thorough at making sure I got the deal that was right for me. Basically all of the top insurers products will be much the same it is the personal treatment that makes the difference.

402,I had damaged my Nikon D800 after it fell and cracked. I contacted the  claims line to start the process. The call was very positive and informative. After the call I checked out the 3rd party name who  use on the internet. I rang them back asking if I could get my camera repaired direct through Nikon and settle the claim that way. This was due to reading negative comments about the 3rd party. A second lady said this was not possible but she more than reassured me that my camera would be dealt with professionally and if a repair was needed it would be sent to Nikon for repair. I was in contact direct with Ival (3rd party) who where helpful. The camera was collected by courier in a timely manner and at the times specified. Once received they said my camera was repairable.

410,HAVING JUST RECEIVED MY BUILDINGS AND CONTENTS INSURANCE WHICH ALTHOUGH WITH THE SAME PROVIDER WERE SEPARATE POLICIES I WAS SURPRISED MTO RECEIVE AN UNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CVALL FROM  WISHING TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE QUOTE. THE CALLER WAS VERY HELPFUL AND POLITE AND USING MY RENEWAL NOTES I WAS ABLE TO GIVE DETAILS OF THE RENEWAL SO BEING ABLE TO COMPARE VALUES.

412,Having never claimed on my insurance before I was feeling rather anxious when I phoned to explain that my handbag had been stolen but I was instantly put at ease by the helpful and considerate manner of the lady who took my call. The whole proccess was dealt with swiftly and very fairly. I was extremely impressed with the manner in which I was treated and the speed at which my claim was settled.  could not have improved their service in any way it was excellent.
413,The consultant who contacted me listened intently to what was my requirements were and matched them to what my existing supplier had quoted. Because we were already a customer of  she was able to offer me a very competitive quotation which we were able to accept. The transfer process to  insurance was simple and easily understood.
414,I noticed damage to my roof on Christmas Eve afternoon I rang  who took all my details and said someone would contact me in a few hours. That person range through later that day and arranged to come and see the damage on Boxing Day. He duly turned up at the agreed time. Unfortunately there was nothing he could do because of the height and the difficulty of getting to the damaged area. He told me the correct way the job should be done when a roofer was secured. A few days later (Sunday)  rang me to discuss the claim and to let me know although there were a lot of people making claims I wasnt forgotten. After Christmas I found a roofer and got an quote for the repairs rang  and got permission to go ahead. When you consider it was over the Christmas period people went out of their way to be extremely helpful and I wasnt left waiting and wondering. Thank you. Good service!
415,I used the online service over the Christmas holidays and it was very easy to select exactly what you need to cover. The online quote was very informative and easy to use.
416,matched the best price i could find but the cover was even better. very easy to set up and great staff
417,the claim for my ring was an easy and pleasant experience it has been the wait for a jewellery gift card that has been the problem after ring several times to be told its in the post then the last time i phoned to be told that nothing had been done and that if i had not have rung when i did i would still be waiting.they have said 3 to 5 working days which they said nearly 7 weeks ago !!!!!
418,good all round service good discount off my home insurance because i have a life policy already with 
419,I was very pleaded with the speed in which my claim was delt with and payment for my replacement hearing aid was quick . I had my replacment with in a week . However I spent a whole after noon on the phone trying to get it sorted . And was told that I would only get the amount my husband said he paid for original pair  which was the price we paid after discount and not the full value of the hearing aids.  would not pay me old for new.. boots gave me a quote at the full price as they where replacements and knew i was claiming through insurence and said they would deal direct with  .I finally managed to get it sorted out by  paying me direct and then I was able to get the new customer discount at boots which saved me ï¿½2000 . leason learnt when insuring you must put full replacement value and not discounted value . . Overall once sorted every one was very helpful and a I am back to fill hearing .
420,great quote and just what I needed and the purchase was simplicity itself
421,Would recommend to friends and family I find  really competitively priced and the level of cover gives me reassurance should I need to make a claim
422,I approached  with what I thought was a strange problem relating to the possibility of a drain or water main leak. From the start they responded in a positive assured and helpful manner. They quickly mobilised experts to assess (who were very good at communicating) the problem and were able to identify and resolve the problem. My first claim in many a long year which received a first class response.
423,My initial experience at completing the forms and getting a quote was good but then I realised I had entered the number of bedrooms incorrectly. If you have more than five bedrooms then the forms are more complicated and the quote jumps up dramatically. Also when I had accepted the quote I spotted that  use the dreaded 0844 numbers for customer service so you end up paying them to ring customer service. I wont be renewing my policy in 12 months time.
424,My experience with  during my claim was hassle free. They were easy to speak to extremely helpful. My claim was dealt with efficiently and resolved very quickly. Thank you .
425,I made the claim and submit the request documents but no response and progress. Poor customer service better to move policy to another insurer.
426,Could not have had a better service advisor was so helpful knew her product explained everything right down to the finest detail. Will definitely recommend them to all my family and friends!
427,Salesperson was very helpful and explained everything in detail.
428,Its always worth shopping around. I already have my car insurance with  and I got a great price for my house insurance.
429,In the extremely high winds our chimney post came crashing down to the ground narrowly missing my husbands brand new van.  e.mailed me the next day asking if they could help with anything and I called them to report the damage. They were extremely helpful and friendly giving me the options available to me. I submitted a claim with a quote from my local builder via their website. This took about 10 mins. A week later it was all paid and the money is in my account. I only wish the builder was as efficient!
430,ONLY SECOND TIME IN 75 YEARS HAVE HAD TO MAKE INSURANCE CLAIM AND ANTICIPATED PROBLEMS BUT MATTER WAS DEALT WITH SWIFTLY AND PLEASANTLY BY . HAVE RECOMMENDED THEM TO ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS
431,I tried most of the other companies but found  by far the best value it is such good value that I checked it several times to make sure that I had got it right. I could have done with less options to chose from.
432,FOLLOWING DAMAGE AND MY DEALINGS WITH  THRU. THE WORRYING TIME I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PROFESSIONAL WAY THEY DEALT WITH CALLS AND THE OUTCOMEEXCELLENT YRS. MR.R.G.REEVES
433,After 21 years as a house owner this was the first time I had made an insurance claim and I thought it would be a lot less straightforward than it actually was. My roof was badly damaged in the recent gales after a large chimney pot was blown off I telephoned the claims line and was dealt with in a very efficient & professional but sympathetic manner. The whole process was very quick and trouble free I was certainly surprised after some of the horror stories I have heard from people about their experiences with insurance claims. I would gladly recommend  home insurance as they certainly made what was a stressful event especially as it occurred just before Christmas as pain free as possible. Thank you to all the claims people I had contact with you did a great job.

447,To be honest I wouldnt recommend . The process was disjointed the claim was not processed properly TWICE and I was constantly having to chase it up. The only good thing about the whole thing was the company  use for their replacement items - they were quite efficient.

Very polite person offered all the information I needed to make the right choice."
456,I was informed on purchase months ago that I would receive a ï¿½3o Marks & Spencer voucher to date I have received nothing

474,I have been unable to access my account due to log in problems despite a lengthy telephone call and two extremely lengthy online chat sessions  with no indication of when the  IT team will resolve the problem. This is completely unsatisfactory - over two hours wasted and still unable to log in.
475,Excellent service all round. Suppliers chosen by  were efficient courteous accomodating & likeable. The only slightly negative comment I will make is the/my confusion regarding underlay. Written & verbal instructions were given about removing ALL carpet & furniture prior to fitters & new carpet turning up but no mention of what to do about underlay. Although it was agreed that all carpet would be replaced turned out that only underlay in the affected area was subject to replacement. Otherwise all good!!
476,No hassle excellent service reasonable prices often only bettered by search engines to win your business. With others watch out especially for small print & renewal premiums. With  its easy to contact a customer friendly company that cares.
477,Really easy to use the on-line or telephone systems. Staff always polite helpful and knowledgeable.
478,I made contact with  as we felt badly let down by our Insurer (both Building and Contents). Furthermore we are now covered for all eventualities we believe we may encounter and have saved a third in cost. We also have our Car Insurance with 
479,dealing with  customer services was very easy and they answered all my questions promptly
480,"My claim was for damage by an unknown driver to a flint boundary wall. Although it was a busy time following a major storm it was speedily dealt with. I was pleased that I could do everything by email including submitting photos of damage and you accepted my first quote.
I was also pleasantly surprised that you paid very speedily on the quotation without waiting till I had a receipt."
481,Have had  car insurance and made a claim service was great cant see why home insurance will be any different very pleased.
482,"Been with another major company for 5 years no claims made but they increased excess and premium. Shopping around I found the same cover required with minimum excess at  for less. I have car insurance with  and the service and price is excellent customer service very good.
Would recommend that you shop around but  for me have come up to be the cheapest for the cover required with ease to buy."
483,Checked online first before making up my mind-as one does! An easy phone call the next day and the policy was in place. Very helpful staff who answered all questions clearly. Sent me an email copy of the policy and a paper one as requested
484,Seems a reasonable level of cover for a competitive sum. Easy to buy and amend quote.
485,I found everything so simple and clearly displayed and expained which I have always received from  with all my other insurances arranged with them.
486,I had a phone call after I initially had my quote to make sure the insurance policy met my needs. When I decided to take out the policy I rang the number given and went straight through to a very friendly and helpful adviser who arranged the policy for me very quickly and efficiently. By registering for the online service I received all my policy documents within minutes. I was very impressed by the service and would certainly recommend  to other potential customers.
487,when I first put in my claim everything appeared to be going smoothly and the assessor arrive very promptly and as I thought confirmed that all would be well on my claim.However after a few days when contacted by the assessors office I was informed by the company that in their opinion the chair could not be economically repaired & would be replaced but only the 1 chair BUT the only problem with that would be that it would not match the other chairs so I subsequently cancelled my claim as I did not want a chair that did not match the set.So please read the small print which I obviously did not properly
488,easy enough as it should be. i wold recommend the product to anyone. i have only just purchased it though.
489,I thought that there might be delays or problems sorting out my claim but  were brilliant. I quickly got through to a representative (no long telephone queues) who was professional and got all the details. All then that was required was an email to send the required photos and invoice and within a week the repairs done and I was reimbursed. I can thoroughly recommend .
490,telephoned for home quotation-was easy and very helpful.
491,The claim has not been completed. I sent a letter before Christmas stating it could become a complaint and have not had a reply. I have tried to call but due to the weather claims have not been able to get through. How can a drain with cracks be left without mending it? I am a very unhappy customer.
492,I made a claim for a damaged television. Did a claim online and sent a photo. 72 hours later i got an email to give them a call ( was during xmas ). So i did. Was on the phone for less than 10 mins and they had sorted it out and arranged to transfer the money into my account. I was astonished how helpful and polite the person i dealt with was. On top of the speed it was all sorted out... Great stuff indeed
493,My worry was having a flooded kitchen and a husband who had recently had a heart attack and was getting very agitated with how it was going to be sorted out. From my first phone call I was reassured that everything would be sorted out and every single person involved continued to confirm this. Although there was a slight hick-up we are now back to normal. Thanks to all concerned especially the gentleman who took my numerous phone calls. He took every concern seriously and dealt with it within minutes. Would recommend insurance with such a company.
494,I found it really easy to buy my home insurance over the phone. The lady I spoke to was pleasant and helpful and didnt take long to deal with my application. Best of all our policy with  cost a lot less than our previous insurer had quoted us for renewal.
495,Since I have been dealing with  I have nothing but praise for the way they treat their customers
496,"Good comprehensive Cover at a. great price !
What more could you ask !
And the customer service is superb"
497,From the surveyors visit onwardseverything went like clockwork and we knew what was going to happen and when.The contractors used were goodand at finish of day would let us know the following days schedule. All in all what could have been a stressful period was made much easier by .
498,We have had car insurance for several years with  why didnt we swap our house insurance till now dont hang around like us go to  now we saved and the process was clear and simple.
499,I was with other company and paying more money. Last year I change car insurence with  than this month building insurance. with  great customer service.
500,easy purchase through fast clean simple clear website. good post-sale telephone support via quickly answered calls.
501,Great service and a great product and very quickly carried out
502,Very easy to set up & arrange what I needed. I havent had to claim yet so cant comment on that side of customer service.
503,The assessor came the next day following the theft and clearly explained the procedure of obtaining estimates for the repair of the damage. Within 7 days an estimate was accepted and the money was in our account very quickly.
504,I didnt get that much stolen a laptop 3 watches a sat nav money camera and tobacco and a TB external drive. I got paid out on everything apart from the tobacco and external hard drive. I dont know why the person dealing with me never mentioned it (bizarre really) Overhaul  managed the claim process easy and very friendly. I never had any issues with the speed of the claim or the decisions they made were very quick. I hope my insurance doesnt go up too much this year as I will stay with them if they are fair with me. (sure they will)???
505,To get a much lower quote with all the benefits of a leading insurer was a nice surprise. It was easy to complete online and all the information was easy to understand.
506,An overall positive experience which comes from dealing with a quality company and their staff.
507,My previous insurer made life difficult when I wanted to insure two laptop computers. They couldnt understand their own policy wording! A second insurer quoted a ridiculous premium when they found that our house was built in the 19th century.  was clear quick good value no hassles. The website to get quotes and to compare alternatives is second to none
508,Haive car insurance with  and now home insurance. Glitch when paying online for it but sales assistant knowledgeable and resulted in better product.
509,I was really impressed by the speed with which we were able to resolve repair and secure our house roof following the recent gales. It undoubtedly helped that we could email pictures of the damage but it was massively reassuring the way it was dealt with by the claims advisor. It took away all our worries about the possiblity of further damage to our porperty at a very unpredictable time of year.Thank you .
510,"I was so impressed how good a service I have received over the past 2 years for my 2 car insurance
policy. That I have now purchased building and contents insurance for our home.
Signing up could not have been easier."
511,Excellent customer service.Everybody I dealt with was so polite.They kept me informed as to how the claim was progressing.Completely satisfied with the service
512,Quick and easy claim the only down side was numerous requests to review the claim process. Hopefully now I have done one the e-mails will stop!
513,I was amazed at how quickly I completed all the questions and also how much money I saved compared to my previous insurance company!
514,Good insurance. Covers all my needs and more. Quick and easy to do over the Internet. Highly recommended
515,What should have been a simple claim to repair a broken foul drain turned into a painful and long drawn out debarcle that took over 5 weeks for the works to be carried out. A family of 4 without sanitation for over a month particularly disgusting for us and the poor people sent to do the work! No surprise to say insurance has gone elsewhere this year. Not the experience expected if the ads are to be believed.
516,I had to claim for a new iphone after mine got dropped in the sink it was a very easy process. The courier collected the phone from me at a place f my choice in a one hour time slot. When they couldnt repair the phone they made a bank transfer. The whole incident was resolved quickly and easily.
517,great experience purchasing my policy and great delight in telling my old 1 i would not be renewing with them as they were approx 200% dearer
518,All was very smooth however there seemed to be a minor error on my documents that I have been unable to easily amend online after the time of purchase. I would have given a higher rating if I had been able to adjust easily after the purchase.
519,Nice to Talk to a human on the phone Web site OK but there are always Questions.
520,Have 3 cars and the house with  and find their advisors to be really helpful and they deal with claims really quickly
521,We had damaged a mobile phone outside the home and from claim to resolution the process was faultless. Many thanks .
522,I needed to feel secure with my home insurance the cheapest quote I had did not suit so I went with best value quote from a leading brand name. I now feel comfortable with my insurer and the level of cover should the worst ever occur.
523,When I tried to insure this flat with  some years ago they declined on several reasons
524,Purchasing was efficient and easy - hope I do not have to claim but will comment then
525,Having just changed over to it came as a great suprise just how helpfull and friendly the advise and assistance we were given in our time of need when we had storm damage done to the family home before Christmas. We would and do recommend  to all our friends and family.
526,Excellent customer service and have. Trust in your company as having house insurance for past forty years have not to make claims so hope this continues but expect in case of an emergency trust the matter would be handled professionally
527,The entire process was handled online  progressed smoothly without hassle and was easily adjusted to achieve the exact cover I required and was very competitive. Hopefully it will never be necessary to make a claim but I believe thats when the true test of an insurance company occurs.
528,Easy renewal. I called to discuss the price and the adviser was careful to consider various options and took time to discuss why other companies might be more or less expensive.
529,Rep was so easy to confir with found it wasnt just them against me to get my money they really helped to get the best cover for the best value
530,I have a multicar insurance and I decided to ask what estimate for my Home & Contents would be. I was so surprised of the low insurance premium compared to other well known insurance companies. s customer service team were excellent and I have only praise for the service and the cost of my insurance
531,we had a break in the pipe outside the house and the company sent someone to find out where the leak wasthe staff at  were very good as were the contractors usedi could not fault any of them.It transpired that the leak was in the pavement so i neednt have used the insurance company as the water board( southern) will leak find for nothing. So i actually made an unnecessary claimbut at the time i didnt know thatt la vie
532,"good value for money
better than any other companies"
533,"A company I would not recommend. After the very first encounter which was OK it went from bad to worse.
Poor communication did not adhere to timetable for repairs. Slow or no responses to phone calls. Had to chase and chase making around 60 - 100 phone calls!! Did offer compensation at many stages (ask yourselves WHY??) and admitted giving poor service several times but this was of no help in getting my house back to a liveable state. All in all an experience I never want to go through again. Will NEVER use  again!"
534,Telephone call received after internet quote was not pushy but informative and allowed me to ask direct questions I had not been able to on line. An arranged call back happened at the time arranged and the completion of the policy was straight forward. Would recommend  for new home insurance policies due to cost but also service.
535,Although  are not on any comparison webb sites I found them to be very competetive for both car and home insurance. For the first time I have moved from my previous insurers who I have been with for many years and will continue with  if they continue to be as competetive
536,With my house renewal only days away i started to browse on line for cover as always happens you get a popup asking if you would like web chat which puts me off a bit so i usually close that site and go else where I think  may have also done that after about a hour and getting nowhere When i got a phone call from  the young lady i spoke to was really helpful went through every detail gave sound advice when asked i got the exact cover i required at a very good price. They also offered to send all relevant paper work through the post so i could read it through at my leisure also saving me having to print every thing off.
537," contact was pleasant and knowledgeable.
Was patient in my many questions on individual cover and priced the product competitively.
Enabled me to add Home cover to my Car cover at a discounted rate."
538,LOGGED IN FILLED IN DETAILS GOT A PRICE  PHONED RE A COUPLE OF MINOR QUESTIONS THEN SIGNED UP ON LINE COULDNT HAVE BEEN EASIER.
539,Pleased with the deal I have got from  - same cover as my previous insurer but considerably less paid this year. Very good website and easy to use. Hopefully If I have to claim the response will be as good - Im sure it will be
540,Having been happy to place my business elsewhere for three years the apparently inevitable hike in price arrived at renewal. Looking at the policies from  was simple. straightforward and resulted in significant savings. When will companies understand that offering to \see what we can do\ when you tell them that they are no longer required they try to take advantage comment wont apply to  in the future.
541,I found the experience with  excellent they were able to deal with my query quickly.
542,"Switched my house & contents insurance to  because discounts offered made it Best Value. Already have  multi-car and travel insurance - so good % off list price which was already competitive. Previous provider had pushed premiums up and wouldnt shift so here I am!
Even when I messed up with a specific promotion the person on the phone found a quick solution. Good service."
543,"I have all my insurance with  now House Car and Pet
The reason for this VERY competitive honest and overall Excellent always in touch to advise for eg. advise if affected by floods
Would highly recommend."
544,Such a pain free experience! Got great deal with more benefits than I expected for better price than I expected too!
545,I needed home insurance and checked with  expecting all the usual shpill. What I got was someone very helpful giving me all the details I needed and letting me make up my own mind without pressure. At least that way if Id made a mistake it would have been my own. Luckily no mistake has been made and Ive been impressed both with their service and value. Would I use them again? You bet.
546, is an easy company to deal with and provides great cover at good prices.
547,The details shown on line appear to be clear and easy to understand. The cover offered meets all my needs at a reasonable price.
548,Cant really review insurance fully until youve been through the claims procedure but the purchase experience was all fine - very good call centre staff. I have my car and home insurance with  and Im very pleased with the members area of the website and the online documents...5 stars for that bit!
549,"Being flooded is no joke.
We were very fortunate in only sustaining minimal damage to a garage in the main.
Some neighbours were not.
Our claim was handled quickly sympathetically and fairly.
The Contractors used were all helpful and courteous.
Really gratifying and what we bought Insurance for.
Thank-you!"
550,Well to be honest I did shop around many companies!!! In the end  stood head and shoulders above all the competion!!! It was a pleasure in the end to talk to people who knew exactly what the customer wants & needs!! I would recommend  to anyone who wants to treated with decency and courtesy!! Thank you !!!
551,When I first rang to make a claim for a leak in our hot water tank I was given the impression that one person would be dealing with it. In fact I spoke to a different person every time I chased the claim. As there were several problems this was not good though everybody did their best The claim was cancelled without our knowledge during the first week. We had Marley tiles under the tank which contain asbestos. One man said he was happy to leave them so we agreed (hence he cancelled the claim) but the drying machine man said he could not dry us out without the tiles being tested so a couple of weeks were wasted and so it went on. We eventually got dried out and the claim resolved. I felt I had to chase  the whole time in order to get something done and. there was lack of communication with the services needed to deal with the claim.
552,"I wish to praise  for their deaf awareness and willingness to communicate with deaf customers by email when they are unable to use the phone. This is a huge advantage and the policy was made online very smoothly. However the follow up service was a let down. Two queries about the content of the policy were ignored and I am still waiting for clarification of the issues raised in my email from the home insurance department.
Customer services has been excellent and have tried to help.
I would recommend  to deaf people and there are 7 million in the UK if I could have a more positive response to email enquiries. The 2010 Equalities Act expects services to offer the same standards to disabled people as they do to others. If questions can be answered on the phone immediately then hopefully  will endeavour to make email responses equally efficient."
553,"I was very impressed with the customer service 
very helpful and explained the policy in great detail."
554,excellent service no problem getting claim kepted me informed as to when replacement was coming etc would go with them again
555,Customer service were excellent and so fair and up front would recommend 24/7
556,Great Service and value for money easy to understand and apply on-line
557,"everything was laid out for easy consideration and the site was user friendly.
whilst not the cheapest quote i felt that  was overall worth paying a little bit more due to the uk based offices and brand reputation."
558,My claim was dealt with fairness and care. The end result was more than compensation for the damages and the process allowed customer choice to ensure a good outcome and no loose ends.
559,Person taking my call was pleasant courteous and efficient. I already know  through having an investment whereby I receive a monthly sum and so was happy to place my house insurance in their hands. Also good to receive an e-mail with advice and confirming theyre on call for any emergencies.
560,Easy and simple process really good experience happy
561,"Easy convenient and quick is how I would describe my experience with the  website. The quote was very competitive and the terms and conditions are written in every day language .
Well done ."
562,We had a large tree blown down in a recent storm which caused damage to both myself and neighbours property the storm also caused a large double glazed panel on the conservatory roof to slop and let in rain water. A call to  had a repair team to the property within 24 hours to fix the roof and the the tree removal was arranged within a week. Excellent response and a personal link to a real person who understood the situation. No fuss no hassle.
563,Simply the best experience I have had dealing with an insurance company. Excellent service great cover good price and I am confident that I am fully covered fro my needs thanks to a fantastic  representative.
564,Easier to use website---much cheaper than other quotes for comparable cover
565,"As soon as the home accident happened I looked up my policy and contacted  explaining what had happened. The very helpful staff then explained who and when wolud sort out the problem  and they would contact me directly to arrange collection of the damaged item . This happened within a day  and a practical and knowledgeable men came and collected the damaged item within a week.They kept me informed of progress and after a few months delivered a renewed & better than when it went away smart cleaned and working perfectly  together with instructions on how to restart and if needed reset it. Works perfectly and  helped to to reduce the anguish caused by the accident to a minimum .
Job well done!"
566,highly recommend to other friends in time for christmas
567,Having experienced excellent customer consideration in setting up Health Insurance with  we decided to pursue our Home Insurance with them and were not disappointed by the terms or conditions offered to us. Our experience with  underlines their customer consideration - and that is very much valued.
568,Friendly experienced staff who were very helpful. Got great deal on home insurance.
569,no pressure knowledgeable and didnt force any issues.Pleasant manner.
570,Obtaining the online compatative quote was very easy and all the required add-ons were available. Very competative premium and very simple to purchase.
571,"Very unhappy with the service given - please note the claim line costs 35 pence per minute on a Vodafone mobile - this is not acceptable to me. I complained only to be told that this is how they make money
Had to complain about the level of service and support as felt like a criminal rather than a victim of a crime
Really disappointed in the level of customer service and would not recommend them to anyone - please do not use  as I felt like I was robbed twice"
572,I recommend every one should have a building and and content cover with 
573,Good service good value ease of use on the internet discount because of another insurance
574,We have been insured by a different company for a couple of years and decided to seek quotes from other companies. s quote was less that we pay at present and included extras such as accidental cover that is not included in our current policy. Excellent value for money and service that can be relied upon.
575,I would like to take this opportunity to say how satisfied we were after the horrible accident at home. Just a phone call to yourselves was all it took to start the ball rolling. Then everything was sorted and all we had to was complete a claims form and reply to a couple of phone calls. How easy is that? Thank you so much for making claims so non stress related.
576,We had the misfortune to have a leak in our bathroom which caused the kitchen ceiling to be damaged as well. From when I first called in to  to the finish of the claim we were treated sympathetically and fairly. The men who came to our house were very polite and did a fantastic job. There was no mess as they cleaned as they worked. I cant praise the guys enough. Well done to them and well done  for helping us when we needed them.
577,Policies info received quickly. Easy to set up! Hassle free purchase.
578,Used on-line facility which I found easy to use. Insurance cover seems really good compared to some other companies. So far so good. However you can only judge an insurance company properly on how well a claim is dealt with should you need to make one.
579,Wrong advice and poor service from my one and only claim I will not be using  insurance again I expected more from a well known companywas left very disappointed in  would not recommend the company. I felt  should have taken full responsibility for the errors they admitted making and paid full compensation not the paltry sum they did pay
580,Got a quote online. Phoned and spoke to someone who explained the details of the policy. No pressure. Had previously been with  but left. Have now returned.
581,Very friendly and very helpful easy to understand.
582,We were very happy with the quality of service and quote for our home and contents insurance. We hope  continues to provide such a good service and would recommend this insurance.
583,Good company with easy to use website excellant help if you get into any difficulties. Worth having all insurancies with this company.
584,Everything went quickly and smoothly from beginning to end l was very pleased with the outcome
585,Pleasantly surprised for the premium to have gone down upon renewal dont get that happen often. Seemed a bit odd to have a customer service operator create a new policy and number just because we wanted to change our payment method upon renewal. This in turn created new paper documentation. A bit of a waste really.
586,My company always used to use  to insure its company cars and that led me to try the comapny out. A few years ago I had to make a claim and was very impressed how effortlessly and speedily it was dealt with. You will always find somebody who will offer you a lower quote than  but what happens when you need to claim ?
587,I used to have both house and care insurance with  some years ago unfortunately their prices increased and I was no longer able to afford them. This year to my delight I found that their prices were better than my current insurer so I had no hesitation in returning to . I have always found the company to be help and easy to deal with. I hope not need their services but feel that if I do I will be treated with respect and the issues will be resolved quickly.
588,ALSO HAVE CAR INSURANCE WITH THEM  THEY SEEM VERY GOOD VALUE AND i HAVE PROTECTED NO CLAIMS ON HOUSE INSURANCE TO.
589,Pictures of door and window locking systems made it easy to identify house security.
590,Cycle cover is an essential part of London life. Mine was taken despite being locked and under CCTV surveillance outside our local pool. s efficient and reliable cover allowed me to order an immediate replacement.
591,Almost took automatic renewal of house and home policy with large company. Desided to shop around tried  saved quite a tidy sum overall cancelled auto renewal and very happy.
592,Easy to get quote and insurance - thanks for the good price.
593,"Detailed information given nothing too much trouble to team. Policy offered
excellent cover and very price competitive. Would highly recommend."
594,Cant fault the way our unfortunate claim was dealt with and how were treated. Thank you.
595,good value policy but received several emails giving different prices. have now taken the policy (which only arrived on Saturday 14/12 after being told it had been despatched the previous week
596,I was most impressed with how quickly the staff replied to all of my emails. The whole process was hassle free and your staff were kind and professional from start to finish. Both by email and on the phone. Credit where its due your customer service was excellent.
597,Nothing worse than getting a call from home when you are away working to say weve got water coming through the ceiling in the utility room! Initially called a local plumber and he said to smash the tiles off around the ensuite shower as that was where the leak was coming from. That didnt make sense to me given the location of the leak - indeed it was the  claims assessor who took time to try to work out the cause of the leak and finally found it - a small leak from the pipe that feeds the toilet cistern in the main bathroom (so nothing to do with the ensuite as the local plumber had suggested). After that the  claims process was first class and a speedy resolution followed. Cant fault the experience having been fortunate enough never to had to claim before. Thank you.
598,"Fast service nice voice over the phone and reassuring. As promised a few days later I was contacted and talked through what damage the storm had done to my home.
The fact that I could use a local constuction company I trust to give me a quote and do the work was a positive factor too. Once the work was done money was paid into my account straight away."
599,I have always preferred to be with  but on my recent claim I found there did not seem to be a link between their legal section and the general claim department it was extremely important in my case that these two departments should have talked to each other it was me that had to ensure this link was created which should have been an automatic part of the process.
600,it is great value for your money easy payment plan
601,satisfied with the response given by the staff who arranged to call back at fixed time
602,"I reluctantly clicked on the  website after trying a few comparison sites.The reason I was reluctant as I thought  wouldnt be able to match the prices I had already received. After receiving my instant quote and looking at some of the extras included as standard I compared  with a few other insurers and decided  was providing me with excellent cover and really good value.
I spoke to customer services and got some further information before taking the policy out online.Its early days and so far I am more then happy with the service and cover I have received.I would certainly recommend them to family and friends and hope they will be competitive when my car insurance comes around in a couple of months time."
603,"I have car insuracne with  and have been very happy with their service this year particulalry when helping me when I was involved in an accident which was not my fault.
The renewal quote was good and the ho einsurance quote they gave me was also very competitive.
I have purchased my insurance online and it was very easy. The customer telephne line is also answered quickly and they have all be very polite"
604,A quick and fair resolution to the claim following a burglary at my home. The member of staff dealing with the claim was professional and understanding and kept me informed as the claim progressed
605,Cant say more than it was easy to set up and very economical. Id write more after Ive had it a full year and longer.
606,Great product and website staff lovely and helpful!
607,The policy I purchased provided me with a very comprehensive policy at a good price. I like how much is provided as standard in the policy and its from a company I know will be around if I need to claim.
608,Good experience to insure online takes a short time and can view the documents online.
609,Once i had clarified what I could and could not claim for the experience was quite positive I had been disappointed to find that items of horse tack which were very expensive had not been covered. There was an exclusion clause which I had failed to notiice .
610,"An out of use inkjet printer spilled ink over a carpet and bedding when being removed to the garage. Because of going away within hours of the incident we rinsed and cleaned everything as best we could but were unable to make a claim until we got back.
I thought we might be too late (some insurers might have said we didnt report within 24 hours).
However the lady whom we contacted by phone was very helpful explaining what might be covered the excess etc and arranged for an assessor to call from an outside company.
She arrived on time and was very impressive and fair - I dont think she would be conned by false claims!
We were given the name of a local supplier we could use at no cost other than the excess or as we did take a slightly lower cash settlement to spend at the supplier of our choice.
The financial settlement arrived in our bank account within a week.
All in all we were very impressed."
611,I like dealing with  because its a hassle free experience and purchasing this policy was no exception. the website procedure is clear and easy to follow as was th online chat facility when I had a couple of questions to ask. The policy was certainly competitive - whats not to like ?
612,very happy the way my claim has been dealt with. and was given details what to do.
613,Good online service easy to complete and would recommend
614,"Storm event caused internal damage to structure and contents while we were on holiday abroad. Reported immediately by Email to . Slow to respond. Assessment undertaken for structure; nothing done about contents until I complained. That was someone elses job(!) but no automatic follow through. No consistency of contact. A completely disjointed system.
Finally resolved after 4 months but was hard work and not for the feint hearted."
615,Easy to set up. hope it works well is we ver need to use it!
616,Buying insurance from  was quick and easy  the policy has all the cover that we need. Customer service very good all in all a hassle free experience
617,excellent value for money.my first time of doing it on line.it was so easy any probs you only have to phone.customer service excellent.
618,I decided to take out home insurance with  as I have had car insurance as well for last 2 years and after getting good service from that side of things I decided to use them again. The product is good and customer service is excellent. However I have just received my phone bill from phone calls I made 6 weeks ago to renew my car insurance and make an updgrade and I have been charged 17 pounds for these calls. I am still waiting to get my phone bill regarding the phone calls made to  home insurance but I imagine it is going to be just as much. If you decide to take out insurance with  I recommended you ask them to ring you back!
619,Friendly helpful and informative representative listened to what I required and was able to advise the best deal for me. Offered explanations on other questions relating to Insurance. Ensured that I had the best opportunity to make up my mind without pressure. Informed me of their site and how I could access my own policies and take advantage of other offers that were available. The best insurance company I have ever had to deal with and I am 67 now and contacted many insurance companies in the past whilst I was trying to save money each year. I wish I had known of  before.
620,A first class response and a quick settlement of our claim.
621,The website was VERY easy to use (could add or deduct extras and see the quote change instantly). And even after adding extras I made a good saving on what I had paid for my previous policy. Great value!
622,In difficult times. Easy simple straight forward cover at an affordable price and a very happy and friendly person on the other side of the phone thank you im very happy with the service i received and i do recommend you to others.
623,Hi Just a quick note to say that my experience of the  Buildings & Contents Insurance was very good. I was previously with a major building society for my insurance and  saved me a lot of money for the same type of policy. Not much else to say but give them a try you wont be dissapointed.
624,best price home insurance on line easy to purchase
625,My circumstances were not covered by the standard on line policy so I phoned and found them very helpful and arraged cover.
626,Average customer service - got some things wrong in the quote on the phone. Expensive Building Insurance. Competetive for contents
627,Excellent and simple online facility which helps control cover and spend
628,Excellent servicetelephone manner very good.All questions answered promptly giving me the confidence that the girl new the product and was not reading a script. Inow have my car and home insured with  and would recommend them.
629,Having recently switched to  for both Car & Home Insurance I am delighted to say that the experience was stress-free easy and swift. The customer service experience was the best I have received from any previous Insurance Company or Broker. Thanks  !
630,I recently made an insurance claim regarding damage to a carbon fibre frame bicycle. The process was quick hassle free and the claim was settled to my complete satisfaction. My renewal is due in January I shall be interested to see if my premium increases at all hopefully not as I have protected no claims. All in all though the service I received regarding the claim was 1st class.
631,Disappointing response to request for a quote - was asked to contact & obtain info. as to what had been done by local authority to prevent further flood claims since last flood. This done was then told wasnt necessary - that info was already held by the broker. & could be offered insurance ! New quote was acceptable & taken.
632,Received great customer service when changing my home insurance due to house move.
633,Bought both home and content insurance for a fair price with ease. Staff were helpful and courteous. As long as it does what it says on the tin how can you go wrong.
634,Very poor website that is very difficult to navigate around if one has forgotten password etc I tried to renew online and found it impossible eventually had to renew over the phone from Australia very helpful staff once I was speaking to a human being although the first call was a waste as your computers were down other than that good service
635,The quote from  was very competitive and made me more interested in their product. Fewest questions and broadest cover makes the product attractive (eg buildings cover is unlimited instead of specific figures you cant normally calculate with accuracy). Their after-sales service is good so far too - 2 focused and relevant emails and 1 text to build the new account relationship. Ive liked what Ive seen thus far. I have never claimed before and hope never to do so in the future but the size and reputation of  adds to reassurance in this context.
636, was not the cheapest. However their customer service was excellent. Had been with my previous insurer for many years so changing was not an easy option. I felt that if there was a problem it would be easier to sort it out with  rather some of the other comparision site companies or those with irritating adverts!
637,I got a very good price for my house and contents insurance with the benifit of cash back. Could easily upgrade cover if required.
638,"Home Insurance quotes from  compare well with other insurers as s are lower than many other well-known brand names for the same requirements. In fact it was possible to extend cover to certain items and still undercut rivals.
With regard to excesses s were about average for the industry.
When one wanted to amend a quote  was a little slow in sending an update.
The greatest difficulty I encountered was when I wanted to do a new quote altogether as it seems to result at first in the old quote number being used instead of the new one. However customer services are able to rectify it when you draw their attention.
There werent really any strange or awkward questions to be answered except that standard construction was assumed to be bricks and tile with no reference to slate.
There was a further reduction in price for already having another policy with  which was welcome.
Once the purchase is made policy documents arrive within a few days."
639,I claimed on web site received a phone call next day to complete claims form sent photograph of receipt via email then another phone call that was my claim settled no fuss money in my account in a few dayspolite efficient staff many thanks 
640,It was very easy to apply for my home insurance with the questions limited to the essential information that they need to know and the quote was very competitive. The only slight difficulty was that when I wanted to add an extra feature later I had to do it over the phone as the insurance was not yet in force. But even that was easy with the helpful and friendly staff. Of course the real test will be the kind of experience one would have if they find themselves in the unfortunate position of having to make a claim which is a situation I have never been in.
641,"Swift purchase on with choice of including any items you want covered
The policy was also value for money"
642,We now have both car and house insured with  and have been very satisfied both times. We would not hesitate to recommend  to friends and in fact have already done just that !!! And we get discount for having two policies with them ...... what better than that?
643,I picked  based on the cover I required and the value for money of the insurance premium. I have a break-in and my claim was moved forward very quickly and I received very good communication from  and its partners throughout the process.  replaced my items swiftly and with a high degree of accuracy based on the description I gave them of what had been taken. I would not hesitate to recommend  to people looking for great value insurance
644,Made a massive saving on existing insurers renewal quote. Came down to choice of two companies. Chose  because of very helpful and friendly Uk based customer service advisors. Definitely recommended
645,I am really happy I switched my home insurance to . I already have a car insurance with  and when the company I insured my house with could not reduce cost I filled a home insurance with  and within 24 hours I was accepted! I look forwards for more reductions in the following years for both car and home insurance .
646,"my experience was not a good one.
I had 3 claims. I was settle quickly but not enough money.
2 other claims took too long to settle7 months !
for these reasons I have not renewed the insurance on 2 houses"
647,Was so easy to do over the phone gave us a good price from the off
648,Easy form to fill out for quote on line without all those unnecessary questions. The policy was the best fitting for purpose and was just what I needed building insurance for a rented property by a close relative. I couldnt find a another policy which came close for value either.
649,have gone with  again this year super renewal price even after a claim.
650,AFTER PHONE THEM TO MAKE THE CLAIMS. BUT IF IT TOO LONG THEY WILL PHONE YOU BACK TO CARRY ON MAKING YOUR CLAIMS WITH THEN. WHEN IT ALL DONE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST WAIT FOR THEM TO PICK IT UP AND REPAIR IT AND THEY BRING IT BACK TO YOU. SO WHAT MORE THEY CAN DO AFTER ALL THAT.
651,Arranged my cover to meet my needs at a competitive price.
652,When it was time to renew my insurance I decided on  because they had given me good service in the past.
653,Quick and easy to set up policy. Good price and documents posted out and e-mailed.
654,"Stone age service. 5 yrs with  with 2 insured cars. Did home insurance pre-quote on website; after submission an immediate call from  call center - ultra pushy agent. Very annoying experience indeed.Asking same personal details I submitted few minutes ago once again.
After payment wasnt possible to get my proof of insurance from My  website. In year 2013 isnt possible to bear all services (home and cars) under one roof and they forced me to make another My account! Simply wicked."
655,quick efficent and knowledgeable staff. its good to deal with real people instead of filling boxes on one of those automated sites.
656,Design of the website adopted a friendly and easily understood approach which made the choice so much sim pler.
657,We had a leak under our kitchen floor that must have been going for some years discovered when we had an electric failure. My wife had noticed a smell for ages but I smelt nothing! When we took the floor up to find the electric fault the floor joists had rotted the walls were soaked and there was a lot of filthy water on the house foundations. From our first distraught call to  we felt in good hands. We camped in the dining room with a temporary mini cooker. The surveyor was quickly round to see the damage and although it took weeks to dry the room out and be reinstated every stage was handled well by the people  put in place and we were compensated for the inconvenience we endured. All in all a ghastly experience was made bearable. There was an increase in premium at the next renewal but that was fair given what it had cost to put our family home back together again.
658,Shopped around for Home Insurance and found great deal with  being an existing customer with Car Insurance. Benefits same as with previous Insurer but less cost.
659,I suddenly realised I need house insurance and was able to set up the policy in the early hours of the morning on line with speed and ease. Brilliant site and price!
660,I found a cheaper alternative online and went to cancel my policy. After talking to an  representative I was able to negotiate a discount. Turns out I have better cover and a competitive rate thanks!
661,Excellent and patient customer advisor. Good value for money and cover
662,As long as customers understand the t&c
663,I have insured my car with  for a number of years. Always the best value and great customer service. The deal I received for my home insurance as a current  customer was fantastic! Both home and car products are easy to manage either online or over the phone. The cover is flexible so I have the opportunity to cover exactly what I need. I think I will be insuring with  for a while!
664,claims people good ...window fixers could be quicker grtting here
665,Very helpful answered all my questions and worries in plain simple language and patiently.
666,On line application was easy to fill in and premium altered for every option selected.
667,I was extremely pleased with the ease of the claim process. The only slight drawback for me was the length of time it took the contractor to find the necessary materials. I did have to request the contractor to come back and make some slight adjustments to the work but am now extremely happy with the job that has been done. I would definitely recommend  as a reliable insurance company who resolve claims and any issues speedily.
668,"I received lots of emails concerning a saved quote which I subsequently took up which they did not seem to notice.
I am not sure that reviewing Insurance is of much help at this stage - its only really relevant after a claim surely?"
669,Checked online for home insurance on the usual sites eg compare the market etc then tried  with whom I already have motor insurance. Quote seemed quite good. The same evening I had a call from  (Steve) enquiring about the quote. He then talked me through it all and as I have motor insurance with  I got a further discount for being a customerthis led to a lower quote than I got from my current providerand there will be a discount on next years motor insurance. I then asked for time to discuss this with \the boss\ and he agreed to ring me in a couple of days for a decision. He rang again two days later  talked me through everything again  and answered all of my queries. I had no hesitation in taking up the offered quote .Excellent service as expected from a Large company
670,Very easy to use on-line system with easy to understand different policy cover fo a very good price.
671,first class professional and fast- stopped any worry and would recommend 
672,Leather on settee arm damaged. Originally  were going to repair it but couldnt. Made me an offer which wasnt enough. I was able to prove the cost of a new settee and they paid me straight away. Great service! Hope my premium doesnt go up too much next year though!
673,Obtaining a quote was simple and straightforward. Great value for money.
674,The website was so easy to use which made it simple to get a quote. The price was excellent and overall I am extremely pleased with 
675,"had a no hassel claim with a speedy settlement .
i would happily recomend to a friend."
676,I recently had to review my policies at short notice and received excellent service thank you.
677,My claim was received and dealt with very quick and without issue. They took all the stress out of the situation.
678,Good value and very easy to get cover that meets my needs.
679,"We were burgled while abroad and  were quite happy to deal with a relative to sort out emergency measures
The claim process was simple and very quick"
680,"Having studied up on a lot of options  has the best policy easiest to get (had issues with flat/concrete roof) and friendly service. I found a bunch of features that were very useful and charged for by other insurance companies such as iPhone cover expensive item cover and they had a high standard cost.
Im quite happy with the insurance and hope not to need to use it but thatll be the remaining factor to consider if a claim is required."
681,The whole process was made simple. We were given a personnel adviser who explained the whole process and answered any questions fully. The claim was completed at a very quick speed. This was the first claim I have ever had to make and was dreading it but I would now highly recommend .
682,I was subjected to a series of questions and actions on behalf of  which I found objectionable inappropriate deeply upsetting and altogether wrong.
683,The easiest insurance policy I have bought. Very competitive price.
684,Very easy transaction. Answered all my questions and advised me of the best options available. Gave options for payment and easy to do. Very friendly and approachable. A good experience.
685,I chose to check on the site after seeing the tv advert many times. The cost of my buildings and content policiy seemed to have become too expensive so I checked the  site and found that I could reduce my annual bill by a substantial amount. I took up the offer and was pleased with the prompt response of a telephone call from the company. After a few days I received all of the policy documents.
686,easy to set up exactly what cover we required.would reccomend company to a friend.
687,FIRST TIME BUYER WHO FOUND  TO BE VERY CMPETITIVE.
688,After talking to the team at  we where amazed at how quick they were to react to our claim. They were very helpful and ensured that all the stops were pulled out to settle the claim and ensure that our loss was replaced as soon as it was possible. were are happy with the way we were treated and would have no problem with recommending them to others.
689,Really straight forward questions and was able to complete insurance within 20 minutes of having a quote.
690,a good service all round leaving me feeling a value for money insurance
691,Very competitive price and great cover. Quick and easy to set up & service with a smile!
692,"Had brief case with laptop sat-nav mobile phone Kindle and currency stolen. Within a week we had a direct replacement laptop on order and settlement in cash for all other items.
Expected to have a bit of hassle or argument from insurer but having provided either proof of ownership or receipts the whole thing just happened.
Full marks to  thank you. We would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending  on the basis of this claim."
693,Great start to notify loss but I was unable to get anyone to understand I was going on holiday for 16 days and would not be around. Eventually everything was sorted quite easily.
694,Our claim was unfairly questioned and had to be verified by a third party. Since this was our first claim ever I was surprised by the lack of trust. Accordingly it took much longer than expected to get the funds to repair the damage caused by our incident.
695,Competitive and comprehensive home insurance - a lot better than my previous provider. Looks like my previous provider was resting on their laurels.
696,First renewal price a bit high. Did a bit of comparison and negotiated a better deal. Still not the cheapest available but sometimes a smooth renewal is easier than saving the price of a pint.
697,Very very pleased with how my query was dealt with. Extremely pleasant and a pleasure to deal with them
698,My claim was handled swiftly and without any hassle. The guy who helped me was very polite and helpful and phoned me to say the claim had been sorted. Very happy
699,Had great reviews on  so thought that I would give them a try pleased I did.
700,Really you can only review a policy when you have been through a claim process... Otherwise the policy cost was in line with the rest of the market for larger providers. When the website refused to allow me to update it and kicked me out several times - I did get it sorted by phone.
701,I have to say I was a little daunted purchasing my insurance without a Broker I could not have been more reassured...I was taken through every aspect everything was double checked a lovely customer service adviser who was patient and very helpful. I could not ask for a better experience and a huge saving to boot. I highly recommend and will be back for a Motor insurance quote when the time comes.
702,answered questions easily and very helpful and curtious
703,The telephone advisers did a great job going to great lengths to tailor my Buildings and contents Home insurance which I must say left me very impressed with the service.
704," has the correct idea .
1. low premiums
2. menu premium pricing
3. clear terms & conditions
4. good back-up service
All of the above makes it a formula for success and a lot of customers"
705,My very expensive camera was damaged when it sheered off my tripod. Called  on Monday morning emailed them on the Tuesday with the quote and they settled my claim on the spot! You really cant ask for a better service. Thank you for a very easy and smooth resolution.
706, made renewing our Home Insurance so simple. The online application is easy to complete and when we needed to speak to a Customer Advisor she was so helpful. We would recommend  to family and friends and well use them again when our insurances need renewing.
707,Despite telling sales person I hadnt decided to go ahead with insurance and writing to say I did not want it you still say I am a customer. Will need my money back. Dreadful service.
708,Our initial contact with insurers was a good experience and left us with hope that our claim would be quickly settled. Unfortunately progress was slow due to our misunderstanding of procedures plus difficulty in contacting insurers and having to deal with a different person each time.Eventually after an angry email we received assurances and the claim was settled and the work to our wood-burner done. Fortunately just before the big storm!
709,I recently switched to  when our previous insurer increased the premium significantly even though we had not made any claims. I was skeptical at first by s very competitive quote but after reviewing the policy was very pleased to find out that it was significantly better than my previous policy. Every time I have contacted  my call has been answered quickly and by someone I can understand and they have always been very helpful. I am so impressed with  that both my wife and I have changed our car insurance to  and once again received a very competitive quote and better policy. It is a shame they do not do pet insurance otherwise I would swap that as well.
710,Much cheaper than my previous insurance when compared like for like. Probably because this company credits you with a no claims discount. It is reputable company and I think I will be very satisfied with the service. Recommended
711,Got a good deal for my policy but then got stung for what I feel was an excessive fee to use my credit card.
712,To change Insurrance coveer after twenty nine years only to find it was dead easy and straight forward was a blessing in its self. Then to find the the company we were tied into via the morgage lender was infact charging well over the odds only shows why we had to move companys like i said with no great effort or problems..
713,Brilliant price in comparison to other insurers think that the blanket cover of 50000 is great.
714,I was with another insurer and did some comparisons on 3 sites then got an offer from  via email as I already have the familys cars insured with them. The offer was just too good to refuse!
715,Having switched my motor insurance to  a few months ago I had to check out their home insurance - and was very pleased I did as they comfortably beat my renewal quote (on a corporate scheme operated by... ). Having got an online quote I then needed to add a specific item so called . The call agent was extremely helpful talked me through the additional premium and checked I was happy with the policy. However I was disappointed not to be able to then log in and retrieve my revised online quote - apparently the systems cant cope with this. Further I was already registered for My  with the motor policy but had to set up a separate My  with a new log in for the home policy. Because Im pleased with the products I can tolerate this but it would be great if I could see/manage all my  policies in one place. s call handlers are lovely and their products are great but the systems definitely need to be improved!
716,Website was good annoying that we had to ring up to complete the transaction but that is the perils of living in a listed building. UK call centre very friendly and helpful. Would recommend.
717,changing to  was so simplistic they were so organised and helpfull and no one can beat the quotes so simple.
718,I already have my car insurance with  and since our buildings and contents were due for renewal I decided to contact  and ask for a quote. We ended up with a higher amount of cover for a lower monthly premium! I used the online quote and found it very straight forward. Once the quote was given I received an email within a few minutes confirming all the details. I also called customer services to confirm some personal details and found them very helpful and professional. I will recommend  to family and friends.
719,Great friendly helpful service always very quick and polite
720,no pressure sale just very good cover for buildings and contents and very good price per month
721,Very helpful member of staff quick service  good value
722,Online application user friendly and the customer service was quiet good. Quote was also reasonable and for these reasons I would recommend  to relatives and friends.
723,A very competitive price certainly a good company to deal with. Now have 2 car and home insurance with 
724,Good customer service offering a quality insurance suited to our specific needs. Competetive prices compared to other companies.
725,"I have switched supplier this year the first for some time and I now have a more comprehensive cover and I have made a reasonable saving on my annual cost.
I found the telephone staff very considerate and helpful but did experience a little harassment with one or two unnecessary cold calls when arrangements for time to consider had previously been made.
I have other  products with which I have been satisfied but I really hope I do not have the need to claim"
726,"A very helpful and professional team.
My claim was delt with quickly and I could not ask for better service.
Thank you."
727,Looking at the small print this policy gave me better value for money than others I looked at. Completed online I was covered immediately and it was easy to do.
728,This has been the cheapest home insurance Ive had to date.
729,Nothing much to add to my review title. No need to phone for any help. Website comprehensive and clear and possible to explore options very easily.
730,I left my previous hinsurer after several years as this policy provided gretaer cover at a lower cost what more could you ask for ? Happy all round.ouse
731,Changed House insurance yet again due to unjustified rise in premium.  gave best quote from a household name insurer. Have 2 cars and house with  the test will be at renewal time.
732,My recent purchase was excellent - however my phone call started as a response to a telephone quote which could not be found when I quoted the number . I had made the call a week ago and had passed over all the info. The first handler had just not saved it - luckily for me the second quote was cheaper !
733,It turned out that a watch I thought Iï¿½d misplaced had been stolen. It was expensive and of great sentimental value. Iï¿½d felt sure it would turn up although I did report its loss to the police and to the manufacturer as I had a record of the watchï¿½s serial number.  were remarkable in the way they handled the situation. They allowed me an almost indefinite time to make a claim in the hope that the watch would turn up. I explained that the watch was irreplaceable and I didnï¿½t want one that was just similar but one that would be suitable to take its place as a family heirloom. I was able to supply them with photographs and full details of the watch. These were passed to a ï¿½thirdï¿½ party to assess the claim. Iï¿½d already started scanning eBay partly in the hope that my watch may turn up and also to look for a suitable replacement. Within a week I had a positive response and was delighted to hear that allowance had been made for my vintage watch to be replaced with a new one. Amazing.
734,What possible point is there clogging up my Inbox asking me to review a service when the contract only commenced last week and I havent had any contact since my initial payment and certainly havent made a claim? My money was taken swiftly and painlessly more than that I cannot say.
735,Firstly I purchased car insurance and I was so impressed with not only the quote but the way everything was handled and customer care. So then a came to  for my home insurance and again I was very pleased with the money I saved and how I was treated.
736,Excellent customer sevice. We had repairs done very quickly. Claim for stolen goods was settled quickly and fairly with no hassle.
737,done online easy great price covers all will check again next year
738,This was the first time I have ever had to make a claim on home insurance. I had a pretty serious garage fire that caused extensive damage together with a lot of personal stress.  handled things perfectly including claim process cleaning painting electrical and plumbing work everything was restored to its former glory and better. I cannot fault them in any way. First class service from start to finish.
739,The ease and speed getting a quote for Home Insurance and measuring against my previous supplier was very good and helped me make up my mind about proceeding to purchase another years cover with 
740,After never making a claim in 31 years The service and quick response to our claim was so unexpected and the best stress reliever after our electrical claim. Thank you.
741,I already had car multicar insurance with  so at renewal I thought I would try them for Home and Contents Insurance. The tool was easy to use and I could tailor the cover to match my existing provider. With multiple product discount the same level of cover was quite a bit cheaper. I added a few extras including protected no claims and the premium was broadly the same as my renewal quote. Sort of a no brainer. One provider now for cars life assurance and home insurance. Makes it easy to remember.
742,"We had to wait for 3 months just to have a chair repaired this was the authorised repairer for .
I would suggest  need to look at their chosen repairers as the wait was really unacceptable the service we got from  itself was first class."
743,The policy was tailored to my requirements and was significantly cheaper than the renewal quote from my existing insurer and the other quote I got.
744,"have trawled the comparision sites but thought would ring avivia and spoke to a lovely operator who was really helpful and got home insurance no problem at the fraction of the cost of my original quotes with all the benefits.
will definately try them again for other insurance needs."
745,The lady who I spoke to on the phone was very professional I cannot fault her. She was following company policy. BUT I was not impressed to be told that to get the best financial deal I must use the optican of your choice and not the one I have been used to for years. I think medical matters should be viewed rather differently. The difference between the two offers was considerable but because I value my own optician I had to lose out financially - a bit unfair I think.
746, was ready to help from the moment that I phoned them shortly after mid-night. It took a few days for the contractors they use to kick into action. Three days after my call a company arrived with dryers and tore my waterlogged carpets out leaving bear floor. It took two weeks for the place to dry properly but another two weeks for someone to come and repair the ceiling. Then a couple more weeks for the new plaster to dry before they came and did all the decorating
747,The online chat adviser gave answers to my questions which were not reflected in the policy purchased e.g. were valuables additional to contents cover or included as part of contents cover? Can different buildings excess and contents excess be specified using web site?
748,Amazing price the best in UK so far! Speedily cheap and affordable
749,From start to finish the service levels received when dealing with my recent home insurance claim were excellent. Very fair claim assessment and valuation process. Overall very happy with the service received.
750,Your staff have been easy to work with and discuss any sticking points of the the policy document
751,~Since I have my Car Insurance with  and very satisfied with their performance I decided to add my Home Insurance policy and by doing so I got a further discount Having studied quote comparisons on the internet they certainly came up as the best deal. The staff were friendly polite and knowledgeable. I would certainly recommend them to a friend.
752,Easy  fast efficicient service helpful friendly staff just what you need when your stressed.claim taylored to your needs and acess via email or telephone.
753,I was tempted to stay with my current insurer but I decided to get a quote and it worked out cheaper. The customer service lady even rang me back at an arranged time after allowing me time to fully consider the quote.
754,Disappointed that you increased my car cover after I had signed up for house cover..I had hoped you would decrease it with a multy policy discount
755,The whole daunting process was made so much easier by the empathy & professionalism displayed by Valerie the claim handler. Throughout my contact with Valerie both verbally & by e-mail she acted very professionally throughout whilst at the same time remaining sympathetic to my dilemma. She was always available to give me advice & if she was on another call when I rang she would always return my call a very rare event these days. Despite having to give me some unpalatable news about my policy she managed to keep my faith in  when at times I was considering taking my future business elsewhere & in the end an acceptable compromise was reached concerning the replacement of my curtains.  came up trumps in the end & even made a contribution to items that were not covered by my policy. As well as having home insurance with  I also have my car & breakdown insurance with  too. The way that I have been treated with my claim has only embedded my belief I have
756,I was pleased about the cost having received a discount for online and also my car insurance is with . The most important is that a friend had a break in and  dealt with it well. The people who came to do the repairs however where disappointing. Although  had given my neighbour the chance to have local tradesmen quote.
757,Its a false economy buying cheap carpets for the house or cheap tyres for your car the same goes for house and contents insurance. If the worst comes to the worst and you are in the unfortunate position to have to make a claim be sure to be with a top draw insurer like . You only know how good your insurers are when you make a claim so dont leave the most important things in life like your home and belongings to chance make the right choice.
758,Persistent calls from  meant I got the best service possible
759,good price look forward to m+s spend hope deal is lasting not like others with new v existing customer price differences
760,my claim was settled in 6 working days from my first contact avica head office
761,"Heres what I liked about getting my insurance through :
- The process was simple; not too many questions and very straightforward.
- The price was excellent.
- When I phoned with a query the call was answered by a real person! No pressing 1 then 3 then 4 then 1 and no waiting on hold while I listened to the same Coldplay song over and over again."
762,Easy to do online. Very friendly and helpful staff when checking particular details by phone. Very very much cheaper than quote from previous insurers!
763,"The only problem I feel  has is the different
departments knowing who is dealing with which
customer because I received double the amount of copies for all my insurance paperwork.
But a very helpful company."
764,time will tell if  live up to our expectations
765,I found the process quick and easy to use. It worked well for me and as I saved some money as a result it was well worth while.
766,The home and contents insurance was really a good deal the only problem was that I should have got 30 pounds of M&S vouchers but because of one part of the questions I didnt really understand I had to ring  and they did the request over the phone and because of this I didnt receive my vouchers so word of warning make sure you go to the end of the quote to get the vouchers......shame ....
767,"Online purchase of home insurance was straight forward and price was competitive.
The policy information was on a PDF file but I was unable to view online or download.
After checking with my system I have the latest version to do this but without success.
So I rang the help line and asked them to send policy document by post which they said they would do.
Sorry but Im still waiting not so good after two weeks.
I wonder if this will be read and some action will be taken we shall see."
768,"We had a flood the day before we went on holiday I telephone  claims helpline and they handled everything quickly efficiently and easily. I cannot recommend them highly enough and have since took out policies for my mum and brother. The claims assessor who visited the house was friendly and professional and gave instant feedback on what they could do and offer.
Overall a fantastic service but fingers crossed I wont need to use them again! Thanks for all the help"
769,We had our central heating oil stolen and were not sure if we were covered with our home content insurance. Contacted  and there were very helpful. a payment was made within 10 days to cover our loss. Brilliant service - thanks !
770,very impressed with the whole process .speedy and simple. Very helpful staff. Well done 
771,Generally pleased with the resolution but there was a delay with the independent claim company visiting. This meant the carpet couldnt be removed from the room so we were left with a very unpleasant smell for about 7/8 days
772,I saved a great deal on my home insurance with your company. Very good service all round I would certainly recommend you to my friends and family thank you.
773,Claim was for new flooring to replace existing damaged by water pipe leak. The whole experience took 5 months and most of that was the drying process which dragged on for ever. I think this could have been reduced if the final pragmatic decision was made earlier. The customer experience in dealing with all the parties involved was very good and I am extremely pleased with the final result.
774,Great customer service I didnt have a problem through all the telephone conversation very nice and patient
775,very well explained and helpful. Gave me time to review and compare with my existing insurance  and arramged to call me back.
776,I have chosen  for all my insurances
777,customer service department well equipped to answer any questions and helpful in their approach to my purchase
778,Have just taken out home insurance policy and cannot believe the excellent value for money I have received. Have previously taken out separate cover for Ipads but have now got this included for around the same price as I paid last year.
779,"quick and easy to do on-line with help at hand at the touch of a button if needed.
Really good cover for a reasonable price with the option to include extra cover if needed for each individuals needs.
We also took out our car insurance with  as well getting a discount as we took the house ins & also discount for two cars.
Would recommend  to friends & family."
780,"We had used the old Norwich Union company but when my ex employer insurance went up too high I decided to enquire from  (now the owners of the old Norwich Union) and was pleased that they seem to have kept the old friendly service.
I got a product that covered my requirements and showed value for money and quality of cover.
What more can one want."
781,First class experience with regard to my recent claim. All contractors necessary arranged by  and regular phone calls to me to ascertain progress. Most impressed with efficient and polite customer service and would certainly recommend to anyone seeking household insurance.
782,Each year i am concerned about the cost of insurance and House and Contents is one of the largest. I was relieved to find that Avivia could help me so thank you.
783,Ive just taken a home insurance policy. I rang the general enquiries line first as we have a special case which I needed to ensure was covered and it was. I then went online and got a quote which was much cheaper than my existing provider. I got a phone call from Laura a couple of days later and she answered further questions I had. She was so professional and courteous that even if it hadnt been the cheapest quote I would have taken it anyway. Excellent customer service is hard to come by these days and reflects the ethos of a company. I would recommend  to everyone
784,"The whole process was dealt with in a very professional manner from the office to the tradesmen.
We were advised on every step of the work that was to be undertaken.
The tradesmen were very polite and tidy.
Very pleased indeed."
785,Received renewal notice from Broker then obtained quote direct from  (existing Insurer) which was lower. Told Broker who still wouldnt match so bought from helpful  person. Will also try  for other policies to see if mulrti policy discount works !

787,Excellent value home insurance. Simple to buy highly recommended.
788,I was sorting out the policy online hit a few problems so rang  direct straight through to an advisor gave me clarification very quickly was efficentfriendly and knowledgable.A great service with a smile.
789,by far the cheapest I could findgood value for money and with a good well known reputable company not one you have never ever heard of from the internet..forms easy to complete and always the online help if needed
790,Very easy to do with contact available if required.What more can you want
791,For me the proof of a good insurance company comes when you claim which Ive not had to do yet however the initial setup was very easy and the staff were helpful. The call centre is very loud (lots of background noise making hearing the operator difficult at times) which is annoying but they are open at useful times. Overall a good experience so far.
792,"From start to finish  were accommodating and professional throughout! In this virtual world that we live in it was really helpful to speak to someone with ease for further assistance!
Thank you ."
793,Very good website easy to follow all information is email so I can leave it in my inbox no need to print it out.
794,Yes it will indeed give me advantage in car insurance as wel
795,Good value for money.exellent insurance 5 star very pleased
796,"Well never again. Sorry but thats how I feel so not a happy chappie

I shouldnt have had to dispute your offer that didnt cover the damaged item"
797,Very easy to set up and simple to understand. Very happy with the service offered and no hassle at all.
798,Decided to change as my present insurer was pushing up the cost year after year. Looked at  and for the same cover the cost was nearly half. Doing it all online was very easy and straight forward. Would certainly recommend  to anybody looking for competative home insurance.
799,My Renewal for house insurance had gone up yet again so decided to shop around. Found the  website. The questions were put in simple English and it was an easy website to use (unlike some others). The quote was cheaper than my renewal for the same level of cover. I did everything online and it was really easy. My documents came in the post a few days later as Id requested. Finally a company that does what it says it will do. Would recommend.
800,Easy to use website and friendly customer service when I ring in without long wait on automated lines. Very good value for money. I am pleased with the service.
801,easy to do on internet did not take long and it was all up and running
802,A policy that does what it says on the tin....no fuss no frills just good insurance cover for a fair price
803,I have been with various home insurers and never needed to claim. But my premiums had just kept rising well above inflation. Somebody recommended  for car insurance and I was pleased with the ease that the application was processed and the price etc. Also the ease of being able to contact and upgrade for other products. So I thought Id get a quote for home insurance and halved my usual annual bill but also had all the additional features I needed for full cover.
804,"Having other insurance with  gave me a discount. Coverage and value are excellent and the service very friendly. I could not fault it and I am very happy to recommend it.

Oldby"
805,When my bicycle was stolen from my shed I claimed on my insurance. Initially  acted very quickly in addressing the claim and referring me to an \expert\ company which deals with cycle claims. The person I spoke to had little knowledge about bikes.  gave me 3 options a hugely lowered cash settlement or replacement like for like from their supplier or credit note some 24% higher than the cash amount. I preferred to use a local supplier however due to financial constraints applied to them by the insurance company they couldnt offer me anything near my loss. It was left to me to contact the insurance company and drive the claim in the end. That said when I decided on the cash settlement it was dealt with promptly.
806,Overall a positive experience and I am totally satisfied with the outcome of my recent claim. This was due almost entirely though to the work of the  partner (I am not allowed to name them?) who pulled out all the stops to settle quickly when I had unfortunately lost my spectacles and was relying on a very old pair to see. This was after  staff had insisted things could not be rushed by their partner when the timescale turned out longer than had been suggested to me. It transpired that the delay had been caused by  who had not passed the claim forward.Only after a number of calls to  - I spoke to about four different people - was I able to move things forward. Thanks again to the (nameless) partner.
807,Website enquiry very easy to use with response by return telephone sales team were very helpfull with good advise on policy to suit my requirement they were pleasant to speak to with no pressure to proceed with policy
808,Easy website and clear details of the required policy.
809,By far the cheapest Buildings & Contents insurance we got. Easy website to use to customise your insurance. No problems at all.
810,Excellent customer service great price for a whole package
811,This was the first time I had used this site and I found it easy to get a quote. Having got the quote I was surprised and pleased with it. It was made easier on the pocket with a monthly payment plan.I also made a couple of phone calls to change something on the plan and found the telephonist very helpful indeed. They didnt appear in a rush and had no problem helping me.I hope next years quote is as competitive.
812,Less than half the price of my existing policy with similar levels of cover
813," quickly agreed to deal with the claim and passed me over to the loss adjuster. This is when it started to go wrong However as I paid  I must hold them responsible.
A flood is very stressful I had no experience of so did not know what to do or expect. I did expect the Loss Adjuster to be helpful and efficient.
Their first visit they did not even bring a damp meter to determine the extent of the damage. This appeared to be a theme they where more interested in claiming mileage and leaving their dryers and dehumidifiers in than progressing the job. My neighbour a builder was also flooded. The builders I got in is also a friend so helped. These advising me so I could ask the Loss Adjuster.
In summary it took over a week to get the heaters and dehumdifiers in over three weeks before they agreed the kitchen needed re-plastering!
I was passed through 3 or 4 people at the Loss Adjuster.
It did improve over the months!
Why cant  produce a guide to help customers"
814,I am most pleased with this company and highly recommend them.
815, is a well known make and I have confidence in them. The lady on the phone was helpful and friendly and gave me peace of mind that all would be well should I have to claim which I hope I do not.
816," website is refreshingly clear and simple.
I particularly like the protected no claims option. Other insurers make it impossible to calculate whether it would be worth making a small claim as they refuse to tell how much the premium willl be raised the following year(s) in the event of a claim."
817,I saved a considerable amount of money by going with  for our house insurance. I will now consider using  for car insurance when the present policy is due for renewal.
818,Generally quick and easy to follow website.Lots of different options with regards to mix and match with which items you want to cover.Overall a good experience and value for moneysorted
819,"We now have both car and home insurance with  both where great value I came away saving money from my previous insurances without losing the same cover.
Thats what we all won`t at the moment surely."
820,"Easy experience when getting House insurance renewed.
I also had questions that were answered well and I wanted extra cover on bicycles and personal portable items.
All in all it was an easy and pleasing experience.
So change to  yourselves"
821,"helpful and handled my claim with efficiency and empathy
Never having claimed before I was amazed at how efficient and helpful the staff that handled my claim were.
would recommend this company to anyone who asked."
822,very good web site easy to use and purchase product all paper work came on time very pleased
823,Extremely easy to purchase. Covered all my questions within the various screen pages. Will recommend to friends.
824,Having had buildings and contents insurance with the same provider for many years I thought I would change and look for a better deal via the comparison sites
825,Good experience helpful staff. Good product excellent price.
826,"I have no hesitation in recommending . Not only was the transition from my old company done with ease but the person I dealt with was friendly very efficient and informative. He took me through everything step by step and very satisfactorily.
But on top of all this I saved money.
I will not be going anywhere else!!"
827,good to talk to on the phone.web page was clear and easy to use .good cover for money.half the price of my old insurance.
828,as i am a new customer i have not form any opinion as yet but all i can say everything was straight forward so far.
829,Having looked at several comparisons to last years policy which had become far too expensive  online came up trumps on features and value for money. Hopefully I will not need to claim but if I do I hope that any future claims experience will be as good and fair as the buying experience!
830,"CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE PAID GOOD MONEY TO INSURE THEIR GOODS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE I WAS I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE FATE OF OTHER CUSTOMERS WHO CANNOT DEAL WITH INSURANCE ISSUESTHE ONLY CREDIT THAT  OBTAINS AS A RESULT OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DOWN TO THE WAY THAT THE MATTER WAS DEALT WITH AFTER RAISING THE ISSUE WITH THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN THANK GOD FOR THE OMBUDSMAN

REGARDS JOJON"
831,I needed to review my home insurance and had not been looking forward to it. However I was recommended by a friend to try . I found it a rewarding experience with helpful staff able to answer my many queries. As a result I found a policy that met my needs at a lower cost.
832,Our claim for a lost engagement ring was dealt with speedily and very efficiently. Staff were knowledgeable professional and understanding - especially in light of the fact the item lost held a lot of sentimental value. I would recommend  to friends / colleagues.
833,Very satisfied with the customer service we received. Swift resolution overall.
834,All done over the phone great at a time to suit me
835,Easy forms to complete on line with a quick reaction time from  staff started the claim process off well. Damage assessors visit arranged within a few days. Assessors had to be phoned a couple of times to get the claim progressing but 10/10 to  paid out fairly quickly. Would recommend and have renewed for this coming year.
836,AFTER CHECKING MANY MANY COMPONIES.  WAS THE BEST VALUE I COULD FIND FOR 2013
837,"I found the website very clear and straightforward. The application process was easy to follow and complete. Making necessary amendments was also easily done.
The policy features were explained clearly and were beneficial.
The process was simple and the product is excellent"
838,"excellent cover for home and content and accidental damage
comprehensive and good premium value.
i trust that in the case of any unforseen claim that the service and the management of the reinstatement will match the excellent care and advice service offerred in setting up the policy.
look forward to a long and trouble free relationship with ."
839,There is not a lot I can coment on because this is the firdt time I have taken out a policy with your company.
840,Shopped around for a while and decided  was a good overall buy. I liked that you could tailor the basic cover to suit own needs. I hope I dont need to use it but as long as the claim is smooth if I do then Ill be happy. Thats what you pay the bit extra for in my opinion.
841,very helpfull a 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
842,Excellent all round. Very good value and easy either on telephone or on line.
843,Phone call was easy details taken and quote was good details posted and within a few days account was up and running on internet due to price and customer service would recommend
844,"Ive never had to make a claim before but I have to praise both the personnel at  as well as the process online. It quite simply could not be easier to both process & deal with a claim.
My problem related to accidental damage to ourTV caused by my children. Once I had provided evidence & the correct documentation the management of my claim was excellent. I was fully updated with the progress & never had to chase for something to be done. The service was clear concise efficient & effective.
Im happy to recommend  to all my friends & family."
845,I bought this policy on behalf of my 95 year old grandmother It was very simple to do staff were extremely helpful and the level of cover is impressive. Not forgetting the premium was very good. All in all she is a very happy customer.
846,Initially I decided to bear the cost of minor storm damage repairs personally and accepted the estimate of the builder concerned. He then raised health and safety issues which added more than 500% to his original. Suspecting this might be a con of some sort I then obtained an estimate from a second builder and the process was repeated but in two parts. I made a claim after the first H & S issue was incorporated and by this time I was out of what I would consider reasonable time after the event for making a claim. After submitting estimates for the damage caused which was then agreed the builder then raised additional H&S issues and required more money. This change was quickly approved by your agent without question.
847,Exactly what I wanted. Cost was far lower than other quotes from elsewhere.
848,Having looked at the quote and compared the pros and cons I purchased the policy and paid for it total. I was annoyed to receive not one but two email reminders over the new few days informing me the quote wad still valid.  need to get their electronic systems connected so reminders are not sent out formulates purchased but thank you emails for buying from them.
849,"Claim on my kitchen due to water damage from burst pipe.

Very easy to get through on phone and someone came out to inspect the damage within the week. They were very honest and flexible over whether to use their workmen for the repair or they would give me the money and I could sort it out myself.

I opted for the money and I confirmed bank details and they promptly did a bank transfer for the amount less the excess. All communication apart from the initial call was via email directly to one contact who I could call directly if required. No messing around with lots of different people or call centres - the whole process was very painless easy and smooth.

I will definitely recommend and continue to insure with them in the future."
850,compared several other companies and found  best of all both with price and product contants
851,My wife and I both have our cars insured with . When I mentioned this during the House Insurance enquiry we were offered an additional discount off an already extremely competitive price. Furthermore now that we have our property insured with  we will receive and additional discount when we come to renew our car insurance. Cant be bad!
852,I was happy with most aspects of the insurance process except that a month or so later I have still received no policy documents and do not feel insured somehow! Perhaps I am just old fashioned or is there something sinister about the omission? I thought I read somewhere along the way that policy documents would follow.
853,Unfortunately i have not had a good experience with the quality of the goods recieved in my claim. I also disagree with the cost claimed by the insurance firm. This has totally been inflated. The actual speed that the claim was dealt with was excellent but it has taught me a lesson to insist I used the repairer I want! I have not renewed my insurance with  due to my experience!
854,The deal for a new customer to the product seemed to good to ignore and the whole process of applying on line was easy and straight forward. The edit option was easy to use allowing me to make changes and tailor the policy whilst updating the cost which allowed me to see if certain parts of the policy were worth the additional cost. In the end I was able to get better cover than that from my existing provider and savings were still made. It now remains to be seen if savings will be maintained when renewal is due.
855,very easy to manage on line simple and unambiguous. The price was much lower than my renewal quote from elsewhere
856,I was pleased to take out my policy with  particularly when I was advised that by having other insurance policies with them ie Car insurance I was entitled to a significant discount.
857,We were broken into - in the daylight with the burglar alarm sounding off! These guys (?) just wanted my car keys to steal my car. \Professionals\: the police said. We were left to deal with the aftermath of broken windows  stolen house keys  damaged floor  etc.  responded brilliantly! One phone call and workmen came to make our house secure  change our locks  order a replacement window - all done and dusted within a few hours. A few days later our window was replaced. We found someone to repair our floor and everything back to normal. Renewed our insurance with  without hesitation.
858,QUICK AND EASY TO GET QUOTEMUCH CHEAPER THAN CURRENT PROVIDERALL DONE ONLINE AND YOU STATE THE DATE FOR IT TO START.
859,very reasonable offer and price and easy to apply on line.
860, was very informative and and quick good repitwar over the phone
861,I had been with my previous home insurer for 19 years but I was paying far too much.  gave me a more comprehensive cover for a significant reduction in cost. In my comparison review I rang the call centre and they rang me to sort out my questions before I made a final purchase online. I could also read the full policy online before purchasing. I was very happy with their service. I also have 2 cars insured with them and the service there was excellent too. I would not hesitate to recommend them as every member of staff delivers excellent customer service.
862,Staff were friendly and polite. All my questions were answered. Hopefully I never need to claim
863,My application was made on line and saved me a great deal of money per year on combined home and contents insurance from my previous supplier. I later made an enquiry via the telephone helpline and the chap even called me back with some further advise which was much appreciated. Very impressed.
864,"Had the renewal notice from my current insurer we have been claim free for many years but the premium kept increasing. We have car insurance with  and that was really easy to arrange so I thought give them a try.

The on-line system was very easy to use and we could change things and get an updated quote straight away.

Buying was easy too as soon as we had the quote which suited us click click and it was done. I wish it was as easy to cancel the old policy!"
865,Well informed and friendly staff who understood my requirements and found the ideal policy at an excellent price.
866,The person I spoke to was friendly helpful and knowledgeable. My quotation wasnt completely straightforward so he advised exactly what I needed to do. When it took a bit longer for me to get the required information and my renewal date was due my details were quickly found and processed. There was no need to call to chase up (as I have had to do with other insurance companies): somebody got back to me within two hours and everything was arranged. I was delighted with the efficient service and have already recommended  to friends. As Im from Norwich I am pleased to be able to say how well a local company has done!
867,"the home contents policy was good value for the price
the vehicle (car) insurance was very good and the service

868,The call staff are very polite and thorough in tailoring a policy suited to your needs.
869,Both our houses covered with minimal restrictions and good cover
870,After reviewing several companies found  to be very competetive. Was able to ask questions on chat line pertaining to my personal preferences and also to print out for perusal before finally committing to buy.
871,had to have my bath replaced on my insurance but  made it very easy and quickly sorted out
872,Finding new house/contents insurance is a time consuming job but I found that s website was easy to understand and the forms easy to complete. The price was very competitive. A lot of companies do not provide a paper copy(or they charge) but  send your policy and detailed booklet within a few days.
873,Very good quote and slightly better terms compared to my current insurer. Good clear uncluttered website with the added benefit of being able to discuss doubts with a pleasant telephone advisor.
874,Simple and easy. Fill in the form with the correct detail. Get a quote!!! if SATISFIED pay your money and have a year of peace and tranquillity. I also have my car insurance thru  and it was just the same.
875,Been with another provider for five yearsprices rising each year with no extra benefits. Enter . First contacted by email and i thought here we go again another provider aiming for business. As I already have car insurance with  i checked the details out. Wow! Great valuegood benefits and much much cheaper than my existing provider.Time for a change and with online benefits the deal was even better. Go !
876, dealt with my claim like they really wanted to help. The whole process with very quick and the service from start to finish was exceptional. Thank you  for your support.
877,"Yes very good service on the phone and a good website which is easy to use! and the
advisors know what they are talking about?
Makes a change doesnt it !"
878,"After having spent years tied into my Banks products I changed over to  on the advice of a work colleague who had saved pounds with . I was impressed with the ease of the navigation around the website the quote obtained (which was pounds cheaper) and the clear explanations meant it was easy to click to buy the policy. I really like the fact that I have not had to print my documents and can easily retrieve them electronically by the use of My Policy.
I have been so impressed I am now looking for a quote on my motor insurance. smiles all around. :>)"
879,Having had a negative experience with the initial representative I was offered a second visit by a surveyor who was extremely supportive and verified that the leek had caused the damage in question. My experience of telephone staff the surveyor and workmen is extremely positive. The office staff displayed a very friendly approach and were supportive throughout they demonstrated excellent customer service skills which I felt was exceptional. The surveyor again was very supportive and the company that carried out repairs were very professional doing a really good job that has received much praise. Thank you
880,I already had two car policies with  who have always provided good assistance when needed. Although I had made a claim this year it did not make any difference to them. The website is well thought out and you can print your policy documents if you want to or they are stored by them I would recommend them to anybody as they offer good service and are competitive with other companies.
881,Easy to deal with and quick to understand our needs.
882,Excellent customer service very clear and helpful advice without being pushy. Website was easy to negotiate. Best all round deal I could find.
883,It did not take long to sort out what levels of cover I required.
884,Got a call from  about home insurance renewal as I have car insurance with them. Stephen the salesman was helpful not pushy and took time to go through two lengthy quotes. He called back at the time he said he would the next day to confirm the purchase. The premium was much less than quoted by other insurers - especially the landlords insurance.
885,No problems getting a quote and setting up insurance cover. Minimum After sales pestering.
886,Helpful and quickly sorted everything. Good customer service. Would recommend.
887,excellent company  all good and helpfull hope the back up service is as goos should i need it
888,"TV with smashed internal LCD screen...

I had to keep chasing. Weeks went by.

Wanted me to have time off work for an inspection when it was blatantly obvious it was a right off and a repair was not economically viable. Then the promised callbacks to arrange this did not happen.

In the end (due to the above problems) a manager accepted my photos and then a reasonable settlement was made within a matter of days (shame it took weeks to get to this point).

Then after I had been paid the inspection company called to arrange the inspection!!!"
889,I saved a substantial amount on the renewal quotation from my existing insurer
890,"Old habits die hard but having had a car insurance with  I considered changing my Home & Contents as offered.
I received a quote for the same level of cover and excess which proved to be an outstanding saving on my original policy within minutes on line.
I telephoned  to make sure this was a true and accurate quote as I could not believe what I was seeing.
Needless to say the help and assistance I received from their telephone operative was first class and I duly took out their kind offer of a policy."
891,Quick and easy to understand on line excellent price excellent cover for house and contents made a fantastic saving compared to my usual insurance company.
892,"The experience of buying from  was excellent the ability to change options and get a revised quote was simple and fast. Value for money looks great.
Just one flaw is that all those re-quotes will each remind you until the insurance comes live so if you edit the quote five times you can expect six emails every so often until the start date. It would be nice to be able to delete as well as retrieve quotes. Call centre cannot delete them either.
Ability to claim and administer online is great too. And if you ask they will supply a landline number to call."
893,As the police were already at my house when I arrived home my first phone call was to  right from the word go I had all the help and support I needed. I was walked through the process step by step. I was advised and helped with the pricing process and with how to obtain all the information  needed to complete my claim.  turned what could have been a traumatic experience into nothing more than an inconvenience and a nuisance.
894,Easy telephone connection. Tele sales advisor seemed experienced very helpful and easy to deal with.
895,"My claim was dealt with very quickly. The assessor was fair and the options provided were more than acceptable. The claim was settled within days.
(Im sure Ive done this before?)"
896,A problem with my previous insurance company turned into a good policy and money saving what more can you ask for.
897,On my return home after an excellent holiday my wife and I discovered our thawed freezer. It contained some ï¿½300+ worth of the usual domestic food items. My first instinct was to start the clear up procedure the mess and stench was awful it was only then that I remembered my  insurance cover after a very quick telephone call to them I took a photograph of the ruined food remains this was then e mailed to them with a comprehensive list of the contents. Within two or three days I was compensated for the loss. I found the procedure hassle free and  were easy to deal with.
898,"When we had our fire  were helpful and polite. I had to ring the call centre at 2am and the call was answered quickly and easily.
Due to the extent of our claim we did use a loss adjuster to work with the one from .

2 years on and we are still with  so that
says it all. Thanks"
899,My house was burgled and a tv laptop and my car stolen - at least we were not at home to feel the violation. I contacted  and whilst the burglary was frustrating I was assigned a case handler. This individual was empathetic and handled my claim well with the only issue being a non settlement that was due to another staff member getting involved and not doing their job but no longer with . Settlements eventually received for the TV and door in a timely and well handled fashion. Laptop replaced but not really like for like and smaller screen but was more gutted about losing all my family photos on the old one. Then my nightmare really started as the renewal was due and my premium doubled despite having protected no claims. Several phone calls and a letter of complaint later told I was overcharged so was not best pleased as without my written complaint - had phoned three different people prior to that who had fobbed me off - I would have overpaid into perpetuity !
900,I was allocated an agent to deal with my claim from my first phone call to  She looked after the claim from start to finish she always kept me informed what was happening and her service was second to none
901,Initial claim staarted well but contact and action drifted a bit and had to chase. End result was Fine and the contractor used for the clean up were very helpful. Main issue was over the excess which no-on asked for until i asked about cash settlement for part. Not had claim before so for first experience not too bad.
902,We are extremely happy with the service and monthly payment terms that enable us to balance our monthly payments and avoid the winter peaks.
903,I found the staff very helpful and answered any queries I had about the policy quickly. They also gave helpful advice on getting information about my policy and aspects of the cover.
904,"Very pleasant telephone conversation which was helpful and informative.
Beat other quotes I received by a generous amount."
905,Have take out house insurance with avia for the first time you do not know how good it is till you make a claim which I hope I do not have to make.But the cover looks good for the price payed.
906,Did not hard sell just went through the benefits and the costs
907,"This year I decided to take a much closer look at my home insurance renewal...as everyone should really. And Im glad I did.
A friendly knowledgeable & professional person looked after me throughout & made the process clear & straightforward.
It quickly became apparent that I would save a considerable amount on my premium whilst improving on the level of cover I had before.
Now thats what I call value for money & I would be surprised if my car insurance due for renewal soon doesnt end up with  too!
Not only was it well done it was done well. Thank you ."
908,"Eventually my drain problems were sorted however this did take numerous phone calls and a formal email complaining about the service I had received.

I have to say overall I was dissapointed considering they consider themselves market leaders in home insurance."
909,Helpful and competitive with good service dealing with my requirements
910,"When it came to renew our buildings and contents insurance we thought we would give  a try as we already had car insurance with them. After the multi policy discount was applied we were very happy with the price and no-one could offer us better!

 offered better cover as standard compared to other policies that we looked at. They were also very helpful when it came to enquiring about a difficult item we had to insure. Our previous supplier was difficult with this and took a lot of persuading to insure it on our policy. Understandably we had to pay extra for this but with  they accepted it without a problem and with no extra charge! Bonus :)

The customer service personal were always friendly courteous and very knowledgeable. From much experience of talking to people in call centres it was a very positive experience.

Thanks ."
911,The call handler was well friendly efficient and informed and could answer all my questions. Slightly disappointed that you dont price match for existing loyal customers.
912,I was surprised by how much better the cost was to my previous insurance. Now have house contents and car insured with . Always pays to get a variety of quotes.
913,This was dealt with smoothly with no fuss. Would definitely recommend using this service again.
914,"my husband dealt with all insurance matters but is unable due to serious illness
I found  to be very helpful in guiding me through the complexities of insurance and would not hesitate to give the company my highest recommendation to anyone.
I now have homecar and travel insurance with ."
915,An excellent service and so quick and easy to sort out
916,It was all fairly painless. The only negative was waiting for the carpet people to get in touch but that wasnt s fault.
917,Looked on line I refuse to pay for phone calls when Im buying something when I didnt commit to buying they rang me and we sorted it out over the phone.
918,Moved my car insurance to  now moved my Home insurance. Really good value and great service. Would recommend them
919,ive had no issues with choosing avia as my insurance provider and always been able to resolve any issues quickly with their customer services team. Ive never had to make a claim but I would like to think I would receive the same level of service
920,Setting up no issues identified but if one had to make a claim I do not know how they would respond. Its better to review after 12 mnths not when obtaining a Policy.
921,The home insurance policy I have just taken out was very straightforward to organise and easy to understand.
922,Overall happy with claim process. Took a bit longer to start claim as I do not live in UK Mainland and there was no official accessor to access the damage. Once that was take care off claim progressed without any problems.
923,It was so easy to obtain a quote and to get the cover wanted. The explanation of the cover provided pop-ups are easy to understand so choosing the sections you want to buy is simple. The on-line chat service is excellent and the staff helpful and friendly. The choice of free internet policy and payment or by telephone and post for a small extra charge is a great choice to have.
924,This is my second policy with  my car being the first. When second car renewal becomes due in December I will go no-where else I am that impressed.
925,Looked at  for contents insurance because their car insurance is so good. (Tried and tested - had to make a claim unfortunately and they were fantastic) Cover is fairly standard i think but the price is unbeatable. Much much cheaper than my renewal quote with previous provider (how can they justify such a massive rise when I have never claimed) . Found it on line but rang a free phone number to arrange it and customer service was very good. Slight hiccup with arranging additional cover ( small human error i think) hence the slight reduction in score.
926,New to this company and I was impressed by the time spent explaining the various policies
927,From the first phone call I experienced courtesy kindness and understanding from all the people involved with my claim.
928,"I am extremely disappointed at the customer service that I have received.  appointed company X to carry out the survey and appoint a suitable contractor to carry out the work.
The contractor Y proved most unreliable beginning work on the rebuilding of the garage wall on 15 May 2013 and after numerous promises/excuses for no-shows the brickwork was completed around the end of June (6 weeks for a half wall).
I contacted  to express my concerns and disappointment but was directed to company X to resolve the issues - a waste of time as surveyor X and contractor Y obviously had a close working relationship and X clearly didnt want Y to be seen in a bad light.
We were then left waiting for the 2 replacement garage doors to be fitted and again after numerous delays/excuses the doors were fitted early August.
Today (17 Sept 2013) we are still awaiting removal of the old garage doors and surplus bricks. An apalling service. Thanks  I wont be recommending you to anyone"
929,Very reasonable offer best on the market at the time happy with service
930,Excellent all round. Great value made use of  advantages for existing mortgage holders.
931,"The whole experience of buying insurance from a a reliable and trusted provider is uncomplicated Any queries are quickly and comprehensively answered through the Live Chat facility which is useful and allows a degree of underwriting of specific non standard property features which is not usually available with other insurers on online comparison sites.
I am happy to recommend  to friends and family on the basis of my experience of house and motor insurance to date"
932,"It was our last day in Berlin and just before heading to the airport I realised that the diamond necklace my husband gave me for my 50th birthday was missing - the chain had come loose and the diamond has fallen off. I was devastated. Next day when I got home I contacted  and they were really helpful. They took all the details and passed the information onto the jewellery department. Everything was really easy and the people were so helpful. I got back the full amount of my purchase and was able to replace the necklace. Luckily I had kept all the original purchase receipts which I think helped. What a relief!
First class service from start to finish and because I had taken out cover to protect my no claims I got a great quote for this years insurance.
Very Happy!!"
933,Found everything easy and pleasant all questions answered with the online chat.
934,Sorted out with no problem good help from you customer service team
935,"I can only say how easy it was to arrange the insurances on line which is such a recent event that I cannot comment on how claims are managed. The prices for house and contents insurance were better than my previous insurer and the accompanying paperwork is easy to understand jargon free and clear.
I hope that I never have to make a claim but I feel confident that the service offered would be quality."
936,"Very hard to talk to to some one about taking out Cover.
Sending a E-mail to you and your policy to respond 72 hours later left me with no cover on my house.
When i did talk to some one it was sorted out immediately.
The cost to you as a company must be considerable as my neighbor was asking me how i was getting on with my cover.
Sorry but i told him to go else where.
I do not do internet banking so talking on the phone is the only way for me 
If you do not like the comment get some one to do some market research looking at the over 50 year olds"
937,My previous insurers cover finished and the company asked me to contact them to arrange the new policy. I needed to amend the policy because I felt I was under insured. I held on the phone so long that I gave up. I immediately went to the internet and did some research. I found  packages were the most suitable. I joined online which was so easy and only took 10 minutes. Their standard policy was exactly what I needed with more cover than I had had yet it was just a tiny bit more than I had been paying previously. The policy number etc. was sent to me straight away with everything I would need. I immediately felt peace of mind and knew  was the right decision.
938,I found it very easy to follow the instruction on line beat my other quotes by a mile
939,"I have used  in the past for car insurance and have always found them to be very good vale.
The web site is clear and easy to use.
Of course this all only matters if the price quoted for the cover required is better value than the competition!!!
I will always go to  for a quote regardless of the comparison sites which I have found quote a price which then increases with all the \add ons\"
940,I had a problem with something that I had left out of my policy and I initially tried to change it online but that didnt work so I rang up and was on hold for some time although when the phone was answered the call handler was very polite. Unfortunately I had to ring up a second time to get my issue sorted as it had not been updated the first time but again the second time I rang the call handler was great.
941,I took out a new building policy by telephone with  as it was convenient but on enquiry no discounts were made even though they were offered on line payment by credit card increased the cost of the policy and they would not accept my credit card as it has a foreign address even though it is Visa card. Questionable if I will renew because of the service.
942,"Unfortunatly I got recently broke into in my 3 bed semi house on a busy road in the day time and a lot of personnel things mostly hardware taken from my house.
Thanks to  they were quick to respond after I got my police crime number an paid out so quick (within 7 working days and I could start getting my things back. They were also helpfull weeks later after I was recognising further items missing and they again responded quickly in paying out!. They gave me options of like for like or cash equivilent and I was so happy with the friendly service and communication with . They were very sympathetic and helped enormously with repairing the damage to the house and replacing items.

Many thanks  a well worth insurance company!"
943,Did over phone great price and cover quick and effcient perfect home insurance
944,Quickly done easily understood website very easy to arrive at a very competitive quotation.
945,"I was trying to get the requirements the same as my current policy so I needed to go back and alter things. Every time I did this I got a new quote by email but I could not see the full details just the amount.
After I had bought the insurance (a major saving on my existing policy which they had just increased by over 10 per cent for no reason) I kept getting emails asking me to buy my early efforts. Not earth shattering but simply annoying."
946,"Very helpful agent who hid no facts and was very understanding explaining things I was not sure of.
Would certainly recommend and good to see a return to the old values.I.e honestlygood value and customer service."
947,I do not have any negative dealings with . Staff were polite and my claim was dealt with very quickly with no paper work for me to fill in. THANK YOU
948,I recently changed my House and Home insurance from a well known over 50s insurer and saved a large amount on my current premium. The overall online experience was very good the main factor being no silly irrelevant questions being asked. The questions were practical and simple. I am very happy to obtain slightly better cover for a lot less outlay. Keep up the good work .
949,"This is the first time I have tried to claim on any household insurance. I was so impressed with the way it was easy to explain on the telephone my claim they put me at ease straight away. The immediate collection of the damaged goods as well as the diagnosis of the possible internal problems was very quick.
They contacted me once all the repairs were made and the courier firm even text me a time that the goods would be returned.
The quality of the repairs are as new.
I do not believe it is possible to get any better customer service the whole process was less the two weeks.
WELL DONE ."
950,Really good value compared with several other companies I have tried (especially with the M & S Voucher which was offered but not yet received)! Really straightforward choice of options to cover all my needs and clear pricing.
951,Excellent value for money best like for like price plus discount as i already had car insurance.
952,I lost a hearing aid while gardening. Its an expensive item and so is specified in my policy. I have lost one before so I thought Id be turned down this time but not a bit. My claim was dealt with quickly courteously and with no fuss whatever. Ive been with  and previously Norwich Union for many years and its true that my claims history is otherwise very good. Nonetheless it was a pleasure to find that replacing this item was a smooth process. I will certainly be happy to continue being a customer of this company indefinitely and would recommend them to anybody.
953,I have renewed this year with  they are very competitive and brought down my renewal quote after I phoned them. I also changed to monthly payment and all went very smoothly. I have no complaints.
954,"The people who looked after my claim after the burglary were very helpful. It was the first claim I have ever made and they explained the process very clearly.
The claim was dealt with speedily and efficiently and I felt I was treated fairly
I would like to thank the staff who helped me.
I would definitely recomend  to friends"
955,What a user friendly service on line. Even if you have to call all personnel friendly well informed and very helpful
956,The Buildings & Contents policy that I purchased does exactly what it said on the tin for a great price that none of the comparison sites could match. There was also a lot of additional add-ons if required.
957,The young man I spoke to was very helpful understandable and clear on what I needed to know very pleasant experience.
958,The whole process was handled in a speedy and straightforward manner.
959,Made our claim very easy and hassle free. Cant fault them at all x rang when they said they wouldexplained everything. After a break in I didnt want any hassle and stress etc and I didnt get any!
960,"We moved house last year and the removal company that we used were less than careful with our furniture to put it mildly!
We claimed for the damaged items via our  contents insurance and were astonished at the speed and ease our claim was dealt with.
We have nothing but praise for the way an unpleasant episode was dealt with speedily and professionally."
961,I had decided to review my insurance cover this year. My usual insurer had left it till just a week before and I still had not received details of my new premium. I contacted  and was amazed at how helpful and efficient the member of staff was he went through my current policy to ensure that  could match or improve cover he really knew the product and I decided to accept the quote which was cheaper than the previous years. It was all done and finalised and I felt very confident with the service. I received the paperwork just days later what a great weight off my mind and a saving as well.
962,"Overall a very good experience with an awkward new insurance policy.
Weve been with  for 10 years but moving to a new home with its own foibles (Granny annex etc) looked difficult on the face of it. The chap I spoke to over the phone was excellent and everything was arranged swiftly and efficiently with good humour."
963,I initially looked at  and other companies in order to buy home insurance on-line. I was later phoned by  customer service and after discussing my requirements with the adviser I was able to buy the insurance which I wanted at a very competitive price.
964,VERY PLEASED WITH SERVICE ALWAYS HELPFUL AS I NEEDED TO CHANGE INSURANCE AFTER COMPLETION AND THIS WAS NO PROBLEM FOR THEM TO DO VERY FAST AND EFFICIENT
965,"We left on holiday for two weeks to come back to a flooded hall. Laminate flooring caused by a leaky cistern input phoned and within a week or so claim was settled.
No fuss I had a tricky situation but  eventually saw my argument and agreed I would be covered. Common sense prevailed.
Very happy will be using again.."
966,Great price really easy on-line. I had a couple of questions and phone customer service..answered all my questions and best of all no wait on the phone waiting for someone to speak to. Great service would recommend.
967,Very easy to complete to get a very competitive quote which I took up giving me the same cover as my previous provider.
968,Buying  home and car insurance online is easy. All documents are held online and can be accessed anytime.
969,"We suffered a burst water pipe on the mains side of the stop cock so the ground floor was flooded to 3 to 4 inches.
It was a Sunday and we expected problems in contacting . This was not the case and I was quickly to talking to a claims advisor who explained the process that we would now undergo. The loss adjuster arrived in two days and during that time a company responsible for drying houses out arrived with the appropriate equipment that remained for 5 months such was the extent of the damage. The loss adjuster appointed a project manager to handle the trades and companies for the refurbishment process.
We made certain that all concerned understood our requirements clean and tidy workingtimely arrivals and departures quality of work and materials expected. Restoration took 6 months and my only critisicm would be the amount of my time necessary to ensure my requirements were met."
970,All done on line and no sight of a policy document
971,Although I found the website extremely easy to use I also spoke directly with customer services to clarify a couple of items about which I wasnt totally sure. The Adviser answered my queries clearly and concisely and the whole experience was really quite impressive. The real bonus  however was the substantial saving on what I had been paying my previous Insurer. The difference was so big that I have been kicking myself for not having searched for alternatives in previous years.
972,Efficiant explaind everything to me and made sure i had not forgotton anything of importance.
973,I received a phone call quoting for my home contents insurance as they had my renewal date because I have a car policy with . The young man who spoke to me was excellent and a real credit to the company. I had to check a few details so he promised to call me back on a certain day and at a certain time. Right on time I received the phone call and gave him the information he required. I had no hesitation in proceeding with the policy based solely on the customer service I received. (The quote was similar to what I paid the previous year). I didnt even bother to go online to check other companies prices because I was so impressed with the company and especially the young man who set up my policy. I really value good customer service and  have certainly delivered.
974,The product was comprehensive enough and it was alot cheaper than my current provider. It was easy to buy the product online in just one click and most of the information could be found.
975,By far the cheapest quote for home insurance with more included than the rest
976,Great service kind and friendly staff excellent.Will recommended to friends and family.Easy to understand policy wording.Will highly recommened.
977,I obtained a quote last year which I was happy with but was then pursuades to move to a high street bank by a much reduced offer only to have a great deal of trouble as the person o the phone had said they could match any deal but it should have been renewal cost. I eventually won and the bank honoured the policy but this year upped it by 35 percent! I came straight back to the  web site obtained the policy quickley with no hassle and was able to priint out all the information before buying and saved money. I would definately recomend for a good deal with no hard sell.
978, happy to discuss policy premium and adjust to a comparable price.
979,"We currently have a multi car insurance product with  and were pleasantly surprised that  recognised customer loyalty and offered discounts from a home insurance policy.
I always do price comparisons when my insurance is due but found that this offer was a good saving on the nearest rival and for the same cover. I find that the  website is easy to use and very straightforward also customer advisers are very knowledgeable quick and have excellent listening skills."
980,I was very impressed and when I called to clarify something I received very helpful advice. I then went back to the web and was amazed that the quote was so good. Having gone down the supermarket route previously I have been persuaded to use companies outside these web sites. Try for yourself brilliant.
981,Though policy was a competitive price getting it was difficult. Was cut off twice on the phone after having got through and had difficulty doing it on line and getting policy documents?
982,Excellent customer service with s staff efficient and a pleasure to deal with.
983,realised paying over the odds for my home insurance even though they said the contents were free. Switched to  better cover and a lot cheaper
984,Excellent service. Helped in every way staff were excellent
985,We had a claim for a leak in the house  them self were good  but the contractor they had appointed are the worst people we have ever delt with the work is still pending after 9 month .
986,"I was amazed at how easy this whole experience was. Right from the start obtaining an online quote was straight forward then I called the staff line and my home insurance was up and running there and then.

I would definately recommend  as an insurer."
987,Looks good quality for money but not had to use yet so unable to say if good or not
988,Every year I research the home and car insurance market. Every year I fail to understand why an insurance company that I have spent my money with does not care who I am or what insurance cover my family has in place. Moreover every year they offer to renew my policy by increasing the cost even when I can buy the same policy on line for less as a \new customer\ At last I have found one company that wants to reward customers who continue to spend with them   - not the cheapest  but good cover  and wants to offer incentives to stay with them. A company that continues to \follow\ what I am doing as a customer and who makes realistic offers to keep my business. I have not had to make a claim yet and hope that I never need to  but my confidence is high that I will get a good service if this ever happens - I will let you know...
989,"I made a significant saving using  due to a slightly higher excess. It was easy to cost options and work out a price that suited my needs. There was no hard sell and I did this easily on line but checked details with an operator before I made a commitment.

I have also save on my car insurance as well."
990,"review next year  efficient easy service  online facilities.
suited my needs"
991,I telephoned  to discuss changing the provider of my Home Contents and Buildings Insurance and got through quite quickly. The adviser could not have been more helpful particularly as the contents involved various extra items. The price quoted was competitive and I was even told that when next renewing my 2-car insurance with  I should mention that I now had a Contents/Buildings policy and I would receive extra discount. Having been involved with Norwich Union/ for more years than I care to remember I was once again totally impressed with their service. They really are my very favourite Insurance/Investment company!
992,hi i needed to renew my home and content isurance started looking online entered all details to  which was quite simple got a descent quote then got a phone call off  rep then she got the price down a bit more for me with more cover which i was very happy withwould definatly recomend .
993,"A few weeks ago I was woken by my neighbour in the middle of the night who informed me that he had seen two people break into my garage and steal my two bikes.

Sadly this was true and I was left bikeless distressed and despondent at the loss of my two treasures.

I was unable to get back to sleep after this and when sat on the sofa stressing about whether I would be covered on my home insurance I noticed that the documentation highlighted a 24 hour claims line. So to try and ease my mind - I thought Id just give it a call.

Im so glad that I did. The woman on the end of the phone was super reassuring. She took all my details sounded genuinely sympathetic and guided me through the whole process leaving me feeling much more assured that there would at least be some positiveness out of the whole experience.

After a couple of weeks I got my cheque and have replaced my bikes."
994,The products offered are the best i have found up to date
995,Good that my personal possessions up to my schedule are covered away from home
996,"My daughters new iPhone was stolen on a night out in London. She was very upset and s kind and efficient service and the new iPhone that arrived promptly helped her recover. Obviously we had to pay the access which was fair enough. We were also able to take a few days to check other options before making our choice.
Thank you to the helpful people in !"
997, have moved ever nearer to giving that complete customer satisfaction.This term has previouslly been abused so much in the commercial world but at last  have gripped the true meaning of this term and is displayed accross their call centre management.Well done all you on the other side of our phone calls.
998,I have other insurance policies from this very reliable company.
999,First time customer. If renewal quote next year is just as good I will purchase again year after year.
1000,Our Claim Manager ensured that the process was responsive smooth and speedy she provided regular and timely updates. This was much appreciated in the midst of all the actions we needed to take after our house was burgled. I hadnt expected such a swift and supportive service.
1001,"When my current home insurance became due for renewal I received a quote that was considerably more than my current premium. When the brokers were unable to agree a premium that I felt was in line with what I had been paying I decided to look around.
As luck would have it I had an email in my in box from  as I had recently converted a private pension to an Annuity with them. This process had been dealt with extremely well by them so it gave me the confidence to seek a Home Insurance quote on-line. i am glad I did. Not only was the process quick and simple the quote I received was substantially lower than I had been paying.
Confirmation and associated documentation was almost instantaneous and easy to understand.
When I had a minor query it was dealt with quickly and professionally by telephone.
Having had such a positive experience I would have no hesitation in recommending  to anyone."
1002,Had already taken out travel insurance earlier this year so decided to get home insurance quote. Extremely quick and easy process chat line was easy to use and answered outstanding queries. Policy documents appear to be fairly clear and all accessible online. Price good so have changed insurer for buildings and contents.
1003,Our pensionsproperty and motor insurances are all with whybecause in this uncertain world and times we now live in we require all the security and confidence for the future we can getso in my opinion  offers my wife and I exactly what we require at this time.period.
1004,"I had intended to renew with the company that insured me last year but their new quotation was considerably higher than last years with no explanation for this. I then heard from a company that had insured me a few years ago and the same thing happened i.e. a rather large increase but no explanation as to why this should be. My brother suggested that I should try  as he had done so to his satisfaction. I did so and was quite satisfied with the quotation I received and the way that
the transaction was handled."
1005,Very pleased with the service and help we received from  and the price was very good too.
1006,i have now got my two cars and my home signed up with  now makes live easy to cope with.
1007,I was very pleasantly surprised as the customer service at  when I called them was so good. The person I spoke to was very helpful and not at all pushy. The price was significantly cheaper than other quotes I had received as well.
1008,We recently bought home cover through  and have been very impressed by the company and staff. The initial quote was online and was followed up by a call to check we were happy with everything. This resulted in a further saving and when we purchased the advisor was very helpful and friendly. Overall Id recommend for a good policy with great service for a reasonable price!
1009,I already had my car insurance with  and they offered me a really good deal for taking other insurance with them for my home and contents. The policy is better than my old one and cheaper. The person I spoke to really knew the product was very helpful and made sure I had the right cover for me. Great service and If I want any other insurance I will certainly ask  first for a quote.
1010,easy to use done in seconds what you see is what you get I was extremely happy with my experience
1011,"In these time of austerity it is important to find suitable insurance cover. My goal is always to make sure the cover is adequate for my needs and is matched by the cost of last years cover or at least close to that figure.
I am a pensioner so every penny saved is my goal.

This insurance like for like is actually slightly cheaper than last year. That suits me!"
1012,I always like to shop around and I tried various comparison websites before checking out  for home insurance. I already have both our cars insured with them and had found the MyPolicy feature to be good. I was therefore attracted by the offer of a discount on my home insurance as an existing  customer. I also decided to take up the option of a further discount for selecting a no-paper online policy. Big mistake! Whilst I am happy with the policy because the end price was better than any alternatives for the same coverage it turned out that I was unable to view my new policy documents at all. For some inexplicable reason my home policy is not linked back to my existing motor policies even though that prompted my enquiry and therefore when I click on the MyPolicy link in the home insurance email all I can see are my motor policies!! I spoke to Customer Services and according to a very helpful assistant \It happens sometimes\ - Personally  I think it should be fixed!
1013,Very helpful staff politely guided me through the policy and what I required then gave me the best policy for my needs. thank you
1014,Although the experience of purchasing insurance was easy and communication from  either by phone or live chat was good I could not retrieve saved quotation. This despite the quote being indicated as saved on the web page. I had to on a number of occasions re-enter my details and requirements. This could deter other people from continuing.
1015,"Having dealt with  for my car insurance earlier this year I thought why not try them for my home insurance?
It was so easy and half the price of the quote from my usual company. Thank you !"
1016,For the past 6 years I have been an  house insurance customer through a broker. This year I also took out dual car insurance and did this on-line & via a phone rep. I discovered that I was entitled to an extra discount because I alos have an  endowment policy. Imagine my feelings when I found out that I was not getting the discount through the broker!When I had my renewal details I insured direct & was talked through the policy by an agent. I now have better cover at a lower cost. My advice is \when you know what you want - go direct & you will get a better deal\ The agents are very helpful and know what they are talking about.
1017,"The products I have are what I asked for.
The service was good and all aspects of my purchase where explaned in clear to understand speek."
1018,"Good value for moneybut be sure the details of the property are confirmed to you before accepting
the figure offered.My property details were given over the phone and I did not receive a written quoteonly to find when the final details of the policy arrived by post and the direct debit had been set up that  requested I check the details. The property was listed as a 3-bed houseit is in fact a bungalow.Take note that bathrooms and any room containing a shower are rated as bathrooms so if you are asked over the phone how many bathroomsbe certain to include the other too. This very mistake cost me extraso beware."
1019,Extremely good quote but really struggled to pay online. Spoke with a really nice lady on the phone who took payment and explained everything to me an was really helpful. Really need to rectify the website timeouts and issues with it too.
1020,Needed to renew my home insurance came to  got a quote a lot better price and cover wise than my old policy and its cover so bought the policy
1021,So quick & easy to arrange no hidden clauses informative & helpful call centre and very good value for both buildings & contents. Tweaked to fulfill our specific needs without hassle. Will be top of my list again at renewal time.
1022,"A easy and affordble way to purchase house insurance
With a basic price then you can add on the extra cover you require at a reasonable price
the total is then shown.
You decide how to pay"
1023,I originally got a quote thru a comparison site. Beat it by going to  directly. Fair policy for the premium. However after purchasing I was bombarded with emails telling me a quote was still available for me to purchase. The price quoted in the emails bore no relation to the quote from the comparison site nor the price I paid. I complained but got no response. It made me nervous that even though I had a receipt my policy might not be on record. Most unsettling.
1024,The reason i have stayed with  is the price the cover and the good service. What more can i say.
1025, beat my previous insurer by miles have recommended  to family and friends easy to buy no hassle very friendly service
1026,Customer service staff are excellent. I like the fact we are talking to a real person in my own country.
1027,"I had been offered a better deal from another provider of house insurance but when I phoned  to cancel the lovely lady on the phone was able to improve my cover with no increase in price so guess what...Im staying with .
They answer the phone with real people and the service does seem to be good so Im looking forward to a good discount when I put my second car on too!"
1028,Service was excellent  staff very helpful and clear without jargon quickly felt with any query.
1029,The advisor was very helpful and tailored the level of insurance to our needs. We had been over insured on both buildings and contents cover and by providing the level of cover we actually require we saved money on the premium. We were also able to have lower access amounts which would save us money if we did need to claim. We were also able to save extra money on our car insurance as this was renewed at the same time.
1030,An overall excellent experience when sorting out my home insurance.  were able to answer all my questions no matter how small and insignificant they seemed to be. Really helpful staff and really very easy to purchase the product. Also making a saving if you are an existing customer is brilliant. I will be coming back to purchase other products in the future.
1031,Very smooth and comprehensive buying experience. I got all the detail and options that I wanted
1032,Very good customer service after I had to call and change the details
1033,Frustrated with trying to use their web site - but all the other companies I looked at were the same - I ended up buying by phone. It was only then that it became apparent that so much was excluded from the policy and to include it cost three pounds here seven pounds there making what appeared initially to be an attractive price less attractive. Buyers watch out: contents insurance does NOT include damage to carpets and sofas and lord knows what. I dread to think what is excluded from the buildings cover. Next year when I hope I have a lot more energy I might be able to go into it in greater detail but buying insurance is getting so complicated you could be forgiven for not bothering in the first place.
1034,After spending 35 years with the same insurance company it was a delight to come across  who from the very first telephone call to the taking out of the policy couldnt have been more helpful thoughtful and kind I enjoyed working with them so much that I have now changed my motor insurance to  as well Ill tell you better in 12 months if I made the right decision or not!
1035,No need to write an essay.. my review is exactly the same as the review title.
1036,Excellent service as normal. Competitive price and policy. Would recommend.
1037,good price policy and service ..................................
1038,Knowledgeable and efficient staff made the buying process very easy.
1039,The best on line service site. Only issue was it was not clear to log on to my policy with my existing ID!
1040,After having a car accident  dealt with the claim promptly hassle free and with a satisfactory outcome. Complete confidence in the product service price and name.
1041,I FOUND  WEBSITE EASY TO USE THE PRODUCT I GOT WAS VERY GOOD AND VALUE FOR MONEY.. WELL DONE ..
1042,"Quick easy response from  they ticked all the boxes for our buildings and contents insurance.
Thank you "
1043,The  website is very easy to use and the details of the policy are clear. Having been insured with Norwich Union in the past it was quite familiar and the cover is very extensive for a competitive premium.
1044,Good price and good service. Easy access on line and speedy reply.
1045,My experience was absolutely wonderful. I got great service matched by a great price. It was all about me and what I needed from the policy nothing was too much trouble even when asked to repeat the whole process for the benefit of my husband. Lets hope in the nicest possible way I wont need to use the policy so wont be contacting you soon!!!! However I am positive that I will be treated with the same excellent service should the need arise. Thanks for the policy
1046,"Easy transaction
Polite and well mannered on the phone
Sense of humour
Would to business again"
1047,I am very pleased with  and also have my car insured with them as well.
1048,My \all round\ experience with  has been excellent ........long may it continue !
1049,Returning from working overseas for several years I found  an excellent option for both home and motor insurance. The opportunity to tweak my cover and find the best cover for my particular circumstances online was very helpful. They handled a complaint I had (about accepting NCD for my motor insurance) well and resolved it positively and to my satisfaction.
1050,Very quick and easy to follow instructions on the website. Options clearly explained and individual costs explained
1051,"I live in a non-conventionally built Eco home other insurers asked too many questions regarding construction although I only wanted to insure the contents!
 no problem.
Havent had to experience making a claim and hope I dont have to."
1052,"I recently changed my home insurance to  and must say that this was a really simple and pain free transition.
The product is really good and amazing value for money.
I am now considering taking out my car insurance with them aswell."
1053,One of the biggest headaches for home owners is untangling household insurance policy differences between competing companies. In addition you have to have confidence that in the event of a claim your insurers will not go for the nearest get-out clause that may be hidden amongst the policy wording.  appear to have simplified the policy content and the purchase procedure.
1054,This was easy way to change insurance and fairly clear what you are covered for.
1055,very profesional and makes you feel safe that you have dealt with a company that covers your needs they contacted me by phone to reasure me that all was OK
1056,I liked the overall package off the home insurance I took out with . It was very well laid out and easy to understand.
1057,"Very helpful and friendly informative advice suited to our specific needs.
Impressed with the speed of and efficiency of service and would recommend  without hesitation.
Gives great peace of mind with the added bonus of being able to transact business online."
1058,This has always been a reliable company in my opinion used them for travel insurance contents insurance car/motor bike insurance - the truth of whether the company is good lies in when you need to claim on the insurance. I found this to be good on one claim I trust that they will be reliable on all claims if needed.
1059,Despite there being no change to my property and circumstances apart from both of us being a year older my existing insurer offered renewal at an 80% increase over last year which was about my third with them. Being now of an age where I do not suffer fools gladly nor enjoy being messed about it was a question of seeking house and contents insurance largely to provide \peace of mind\ in case a disaster happened. I consulted a trusted website which advised a comparison site and then a couple of named companies. One of my targets was to insure with a known company - which ruled out quite a few that came up in the comparison list - and the prime requisite was to avoid as much hassle as possible. To my surprise  fulfilled all my requirements firstly on line and subsequently by phone - in English - pleasantly efficiently and at a reasonable cost. All in all I feel I have done myself a favour!
1060,Customer Service Advisor was extremely helpful they listened and adjusted the policy to suit US. There was not the Hard Sell but willingness to ensure we ( the Customer) got what we reasonably required. The Policy limits were easily adjusted upwards and the premium remained extremely competitive Returned phone calls were always punctual and polite. The Policy Documents arrived within 3 days . We now have in place a comprehensive House and Contents policy at a very competitive price with peace of mind for another 12 months.
1061,Telephone call was answered within seconds and I was speaking to a \real\ person within seconds who was knowledgeable and helpful
1062,"Changing to another insurer can be an arduous time consuming process but I am glad I made the call to .
I was soon connected to an extremely pleasant and helpful person who arranged a policy at the right level and the right price in a reasonable time."
1063,I found it very easy to buy this home insurance online and liked it very much because it was lots cheaper than my existing cover which I had for a couple of years with my bank. When they increased my renewal by nearly ï¿½300 I knew it was time for a change and am very pleased with everything about s policy.
1064,Taken out new policy as much better price than existing insurance company. Easy to use computer system for quote etc. and customer service on phone were great. Answered quickly understood what they were saying and were really helpful. Would recommend.
1065,Very good easy to do just the cover I needed. Thank you.
1066,I have used  this year for al my insurances home car and travel. I have done this because they are value for money have excellent benefits as standard and compared to other quotes I received they were mile ahead. I had to phone there customer services dept. because I could not believe the online quote I had been given.  have far exceeded my expectations for insurance for once I did not feel I was being ripped off. I received the cover I required at a good price what else can you ask for.
1067,Give  the opportunity to quote for you and you will find it worth it
1068,Excellent customer service well impressed with the help I received and the advisor involved
1069,One good point is that  do not seem to have \hidden\ conditions which are difficult to meet - such as some other Insurers. Two other leading brands that I tried have \hidden\ conditions for patio doors and windows which are very difficult to comply with in practice - thus making it easier for them to opt out of a claim for burglary for instance.
1070,Customer services were polite and well briefed on their products. They informed me of ways to save and get better value for money without giving me the hard sell.
1071,We made a mistake on personal belongings section. We read ï¿½2000 as standard with an option to increase above that amount. Turns out 0 is standard and we are not covered. Apart it seems good value.
1072,"Fantastic price and product contains great extras to my previous insurer.

Had to phone to ask questions before purchase helpful staff though I was told two different answers so phone a third time and took the two out of three option! Hopeful they were right should I ever be unfortunate enough to have to claim"
1073,Easily beat all the competition. I tried all the comparison websites and  beat them all. Perfect package to suit my requirements.
1074,I found my regular insurers premiums for my Listed and very old house were getting far too high and I looked for alternatives with the same cover. A colleague was very satisfied with  and I have found a similar very satisfactory experience in switching to . Claims experience is of course the telling point with insurance but I hope not to test this aspect of my policy.
1075,"Frustrated by work in progress on your web site upgrade I phoned an advisor with some concern.
However the adviser was really helpful obviously well trained.
Information was transparent with no tricks
I gladly changed
My existing supplier then became transformed but too little too late"
1076,"Renewing my insurance with the same company is a bit old fashioned but once you get to speak to a person at  they will offer a decent discount if you have more than 1 policy with them.
I called to ask why my van insurance was more expensive with no claims made and that I wanted to give them a chance to offer me a loyalty discount as by clicking around the comparison sites I would have easily beaten the renewal quote-  came up trumps and have kept my business."
1077,This is not a standard product at . Customer Services went out of their way to get their underwriter to provide us suitable cover (at a very competitive price).
1078,The whole buying experience was very easy excellent web site which was easy to understand. The on line application was simple and I was able to complete it in a few minutes. The insurance coverage appears to be very comprehensive and better than most other companies. I had to telephone to make one small amendment to my policy the person that I spoke with was pleasant and efficient. Pity about the 044 telephone number this I feel should be an 0800 or a 01.
1079,I likethe discounts on various products extremely helpful on phone .
1080,Only after I was called back the day after the first quotation did the premium come down to the level I wanted. both calls were handled well and pleasantly.
1081,I found  the losest quote by a mile than any other quote I got. I also have car and holiday insurance with them which is also very good. The holiday insurance I have had for several years and the car 2 years.
1082,I was already an  policy holder but took the opportunity to move my house insurance policy. Website gave me all the options to play around with and gave immediate premiums to compare. Ended up making some great savings for better cover. Would recommend.
1083,the website was easy to use and when I needed clarification on a specific item the person on the end of the phone was most helpful. Purchased the policy on line which means that there are no reams of paper sent out to me but when i need any info all I have to do it log on.
1084,Very pleased with my home contents insurance as an ex-Norwich Union employee I can vouch for the excellence of the insurance products offered by  and their post sales service. And I will remain loyal to  as they continue to support their pensioners.
1085,Easy peasey give it a try the quote you get wont leave a tear in your eye.
1086, are the best value for money insurance company They beat all the comparison web sites and are easy to deal with.  run a professional and helpful customer service department. I am very happy with my dealings with them.
1087,"After visiting all the comparison sites on the internet s
home cover gave me the cover I wanted at a very competitive price and easy to policy details."
1088,very helpful and helped me find the right product.
1089,"No 1  made the setting up of a multi-car policy so easy and simple and I saved on my wifes car insurance.

No 2  added my car to the multi-car policy and saved me money again.

No 3  quoted me for my home insurance and as I already had other policies saved me money again.
It was as easy as 1-2-3."
1090,The service was excellent I was called back on numerous occasions but there was no pressure to make a decision. Everyone I spoke to was pleasant and respectful. When I finally committed it was by far the best deal and they also reminded me I would get discounts for another insurance policy I had. A refreshing and professional experience and I could understand everyone I spoke too. How unusual!
1091,Home insurance at a great price with vouchers thrown in as a bonus and the additional bonus of lowering my car insurance quote as an existing policy holder. Excellent customer services and very easy to maintain your policies online without having reams of paper.
1092,Ease of use of the web site very clear instructions and would appear to be very good value for money.
1093,Great competitive price and excellent customer service.
1094,We have for several years had two cars insured with  and have been very satisfied with cost and efficiency. When renewing our house insurance we switched to  when our existing providers quote was very high. s quote was much more reasonable. We appreciated the ease with which we were able to secure insurance on-line- the on-line system is very quick and efficient.
1095,"Everything good about  but being as poor as the proverbial church mouse I have had to accept rather limited cover.
All the same it was simple to achieve fast and friendly and I thoroughly recommend  for your home insurance.
I dont always go back to last years insurer because I can usually get a lower price elsewhere but not this year nor last !"
1096,As I am not very good with computers I found the web pages easy to use. The price was very favourable compared to quotes received and via comparison sites. Plus the price remained constant while I considered other options!!
1097,I would highly recommend  insurance. I did it all on line in a matter of minutes its so worth it. Why take the risk and leave yourself without insurance when  have made it this simple.
1098,Having become dis-illusioned with my current home insurance provider I decided to ask \\for a quote online. I found the website easy to navigate and the actual quote far better value than my current provider. I immediately accepted the quote from  and cancelled my existing policy online.i was prompted to go to  as I already have my car insurance through them and have found the service very good thus far.
1099,Satisfied with the service. We also have holiday and car insurance with .
1100,Good value for money package for buildings and contents.
1101,"Always dealt through a broker in the past and decided this time to try on line with a reputable company that I had some small knowledge of.
Getting a quotation proved to be easier than expected and their follow up by telephone helped answer a number of areas that required clarification.
The premium resulted in a good cost saving."
1102,excellent web site and contact with staff[have had previous contact with car quote
1103,After searching through other Insurance providers websites and finding the experience less than inspiring i eventually came to the  site. It is clear informative but above all easy to use and quick to complete your quote and then policy approval. From start to finish it took me less than 15 minutes! Excellent service.
1104,I was glad that I obtained a quote from . Having had Buildings cover as part of my mortgage I was obviously delighted that Buildings and Contents cover worked out cheaper that just Buildings cover with my mortgage provider. The reason for seeking cover was because my mortgage is now fully paid and I needed to have the buildings cover.
1105,Very friendly & helpful staff who seemed knowledgible and willing to assist with customer requirements. Worked well to tailor policy to suit. A good value product and price. I only hope that continued business is valued as well as new business when it comes round for renewal. Time will tell.
1106,found customer services to be extremely helpful and very efficient i would definately consider having all my insurances through .
1107,Good value for money. Competent and fast service. Very good internet website.
1108,Salesmanship very balanced and patient hope this will transfer if ever we need to claim.
1109,"The staff had full knowledge of the product
and quickly arrived at cover requirements and price .Quick conclusion"
1110,A straight foreward telephone call and after 10 to 15 mins i was insured for my home contents at a price i was happy with paid up front for one years cover job done.
1111,great policy and really good value for money. Much better than many other insurance companies.
1112,very nice girlmade the sale for you give her a bonus!
1113,This was really easy to do the price was fantastic compared with my previous insurance provider. It definitely pays to spend a little bit of time to compare and then take advantage of the fantastic offers from 
1114,It seems to be a good value home and contents policy
1115,Everything was explained in detail and the agent was brilliant could not have done any more or any better thank you
1116,"great value plus cashback
easy to use online
documents online so no thick paper pack"
1117, provides excellent value for the insurance product I purchased last week. Very competitive in price and also excellent customer services.
1118,I found your service very helpful. You explained every step of the way. You helped me find what insurance i needed to be covered. You helped put my mind at ease. I will be giving your name to my friends as you give great value and these days you need to save as much as possible but still give great value cover.Thank You.
1119,Staff very helpful and completely upfront about the ts and cs on this product. Very good price for comparable insurance.
1120,"Delighted to offer my feedback to another comprehensive  insurance product.

- easy to set-up and amend on-line if need be
- comprehensive and flexible cover to match your exact needs
- fair cost when you consider the features the cover provides

Plus  always value their existing customers with generous loyalty discounts.

In essence  always work with you to protect your interests..."
1121,I found that the Home cover I selected was very good value for money and covered all of my needs. i also have piece of mind in respect of dealing with a professional company that is well known and well respected
1122,"I tried  since my current insurer wanted a price hike. I checked online at two of the major comparison sites and then phoned viva. I was pleasantly surprised. Very good price for what they offer. The service was first rate. Cant fault them so far.
Recommended."
1123,Seamless transaction and good value building and contents.
1124,"Getting quote on line no problem.
Sales follow up person agreed to reduce price because I raised I had other policies and was expecting a discount.
When I came to purchase a few days later the Web site would not accept the quote number (even though this is auto filled by ).
During the phone call to purchase the policy.I was advised I could return on line to purchase and I would retain the M&S vouchers on offer or if the sales person completed for me I would not receive them.
Having spent a lot of time already I agreed for  to complete the transaction over the phone. During the course of the conversation I was advised that there were two figures on the same quote number which cover did I require? the one I entered on line I replied In that case the original quote would apply as I had changed the cover to reduce the premium.I HAD NOT the sales person had reduced my premium by reducing cover of the policy not because I had other policies.Not such a good deal."
1125,Was persuaded to enquire for house insurance after having temporary motor insurance on purchase of new car. The deal bettered my renewal quote by a significant amount and the transaction was done over the phone in a matter of minutes by a very pleasant member of staff.
1126,Good quick service no hassle a lot cheaper than my last. Quote
1127,I have  car insurance and was offered a \discount\ if I took out home insurance when my current one was due. I was amazed at the saving I made  and couldnt better it when I searched via various comparison websites  even when I went direct. They followed up my initial online quote with a phone call  which enabled me to question some items and I increased my cover  but even then the final quote was extremely reasonable. Have already recommended that others check them out before renewing elsewhere.
1128,easy to purchase this home insurance with a helpful adviser
1129,Easy to purchase great cover and excellent value for money. I can also recommend the multi-car motor insurance too!
1130,Easy to use website with fast online quote. Polite and efficient phone follow up service to check quote and make any manual adjustments. No paper involved all business conducted via email.
1131,"I regularly review my house insurance when the premium becomes due and like many others find that after the initial cost the premium can show a hefty increase despite no claim being made. I usually contact the insurer to ascertain if they can match or at least reduce the premium to an acceptable level which sometimes works but not always.
Shopping around this time I found that 
produced a very acceptable quote which my previous insurer did not even try to come near and therefore I have changed. Hopefully when the renewal is next due the premium will still be competitive.
I would recommend paying an additional ï¿½3. for the policy booklet etc. to be sent out by post as printing it uses a fair amount of paper and ink.

Finally I note that the Government have recently been urged to review the question of renewal premiums and to avoid changing insurers each year it would make sense to agree a solution."
1132,Ease of purchase on line as we were moving home policy was transferred with ease. Would certainly reccomend  based on current experience.
1133,Filled in on line enquiry form which I couldnt complete as my address was not listed in the list provided. I was told to ring to proceed with my enquiry although  reps rang me as I didnt complete the on line enquiry. The young man I spoke to was helpful and efficient
1134,"VERY HAPPY
AND VERY GOOD VALUE.
WILL USE FOR CAR WHEN DUE.
MANY THANKS TO ALL."
1135,thought  would be more expensive than the rest but very good value for money simple straightforward form to fill in no hassle quick and easy
1136,"Decided I was just letting my insurances roll on and should do a comparison to try to save some money.
The  quote - encompasing all the features of my existing insurance was way better than my suggested renewal premium so I took it up and saved a bundle. I am really pleased."
1137,I was surprised by the low contents insurance quote in comparison to the supposed \loyalty\ quote given to me by a company I had been with for some 7 years! Would recommend to anyone.

At one stage I had a problem with contacting  on line but I had a lot of help from the gentleman on the other end of the phone.

I have previously used  for my car insurance and found the same thing Everything happened as was stated and I have confidence in the system.

1152,Having  car insurance for the current year I was contacted by them to see if I was interested in home and contents insurance.

The premium was considerably less than with my previous insurer and after checking various comparison websites the offer was taken up.
1153,Off all the sites I looked at I found this one the least complicated. I could follow the steps and felt confident that policy I put together was the right one for me.
1154,"I wanted a Home Insurance policy recently and having been quoted a 30% increase on last year I decided a change was necessary.
Having looked on the internet I found that Martins Money tips mentioned  had a reasonably priced policy.
Upon enquiring I was asked if I had any other policies with them.
Because I had another policy I received further discount.

My hope is that two years or so down the line they will still reward loyalty especially if you have no claims."
1155,Home insurance policy dealt with very professionally and my requests were taken care of and included in the policy.
1156,Very easy to input information on the computer. Excellent customer service by telephone when ringing to query one particular part of the policy. No extra charge for paying on a monthly basis.

1158,"easy to apply on line
good value for the cover it gives
great to know as a customer already that you receive extra discount"
1159,very satisfied with quotation price and customer service conducted in a professional manner. I would have no hesitation in recommending  to others
1160,Adding Home insurance to a joint policy that I already had for two cars was easy to do online and the discount was attractive. I have found  friendly and helpful if I have had to call them.
1161,"Bought policy on-line very easy site to use I did have to ring customer services to correct an error on direct debit mandate the person I spoke to was really helpful and polite.

I havent obviously made a claim so cant comment on that."
1162,Recently brought buildings and contents insurance. Was very impressed by the excellent customer service all the way through. Every person I spoke to was polite and genuinely help to solve any problems. Pre-empted problems and sorted out with ease. Would highly recommend.
1163,Insurance renewal is normally a bind but my recent experience with  was a trouble free experience! Thank you to  for the clarity of the proposals and the helpful staff at the Glasgow call centre who were extremely helpful.
1164,Follow up phone call to discuss requirements after on-line quote was helpful
1165,efficient service cost savings on previous quote would recommend
1166,"It is a delight to be able to endorse all five of the ratings including the summary as excellent.

Would I recommend  to a friend?

Already have."
1167,The response to my online quote was quickly followed by a phone call and the caller was helpful without being pushy. Customer service was good.
1168,good value for money and ease of transaction. great advice over the phone made it so simple
1169,I have been with  on my motor policy for the third year. I am now a multicar policy holder. As well as getting great discount on this i now get a greater one on my home policy. This helped in undercutting greatly the company i was with giving me all the same benefits and a couple more. I look forward to staying here for a long time.
1170,We have just bought our first home and my Dad recommended that I use  as it would cover both buildings and contents and specified items in one straight-forward policy
1171,"After purchasing car insurance I was informed about home insurance
I wasnt ready to re new my existing policy but when the time came I gave  a call
It was so easy to arrange and involved a fantastic saving in money from what I was paying my insurance provider who I had been with for years
I would have no hesitation in recommending  every time"
1172,Chose  after trawling the usual comparison sites. Already use  for Car insurance and experience has been good. Used the on-line Chat service and they were able to better like for like offers from other Insurers.
1173,"One of the easiest websites to use.
I now have all my policies with ."
1174,I arranged my home insurance on the phone like the good old days and it was far easier than arranging it online. Having taken out the insurance confirmation was followed up by an email and then by post as promised and  couldnt have been more efficient. The price was such that I didnt need to go off and compare it and was a fair bit cheaper than last year (which I did arrange online elsewhere). So all in all a happy experience !
1175,Very easy to set up and helpful staff plus excellent value for money
1176,very helpful and easy to get insurance I wanted at a very reasonable price
1177, gave me a very competetive dicounted insurance taking into account that no claims were made in many years buildings and contents were combined and another insurance is held with the company. All in all I am happy with the quote given and would recommend .
1178,"I was able to reduce my premium because  recognized the fact that I havent had a claim in many years and because I took out buildings and contents together and also already have another insurance with the company. All in all the insurance premium was very competetive with a good level of policy features and benefits.
PS: The excess of ï¿½3000 for subsidence does not compare well with quotes from other Insurance companies!"
1179,"great friendly customer services
everything I wanted to know properly explained
good value for money especially nowadays when cost
keep rising"
1180,"We already have our cars insured with  and ave been very satisfied by the care provided. Recently moved our Home insurance to  and expect similar service.
Customer service over the phone were very good. I had to go through telephone rather than online because there were one or two points not quite clear on line.

Keep it up  Id say!"
1181,On receiving renewal of our current policy we carried out a comparison with other companies. Although not quite the cheapest  provided the best option by matching the requirements of our current policy and at a much cheaper rate than our existing policy. The online service was quick and easy to use and payment was painless.
1182,Easy to generate a quote add options and pay. A competitive price which provides good cover.
1183,Quick phone call tailored policy friendly staff. Competitive price for comprehensive policy
1184,This was a straightforward business transaction with no smart marketing ploys or inappropriate familiarity. I liked it that way and felt I was being offered a very reasonable deal. I was dealt with politely quickly and efficiently. The policy has arrived promptly and is in good order.
1185,"Knowledgable staff patiently helped us through finding our requirements and other providing information on other options we had not fully considered but realised would provide comprehensive cover if ever needed. Some of the extra cover we added on was not as much of a cost as we may have imagined. Found the quote very competive in comparison to others we had been given.
Went through smoothly and felt satisfied we came away with adequate cover for our needs at competitive price on a product we essentially required."
1186,very please with the advice from sales on this policy  are very competitive on price I now have car & home content policys with them would recommend  to my friends
1187,Great companyif you have a problem they help you at any time his policy is very cheap.
1188,Easy to use website. Informative and excellent value for money. Comprehensive policy with excellent standard of cover as standard and plenty of extra options. Lived up to advertising and produced big savings against like for like alternatives.
1189,Having received my renewal notice for home insurance I decided to try  for a quote.(I already hold my car insurance with ) and was pleasantly surprised with the quote and discount given as an existing customer. I accepted the quote and purchased saving myself a considerable amount for an excellent product.
1190,"My experience has been gold star with who ever I have spoken to.
I have been helped in my limited knowledge of the internet & on phoning because I was still not certain of the cover I was again helped to my satisfaction."
1191,The staff at  are very helpful and one of the best insurance company I have insurance with. Very good policy features and benefits and value for money.
1192,Price was the same as my renewal else where but I have got PROPER value cover with much better terms and limits with !
1193,"I recently took out car insurance with  after being a life long customer to another large well known insurer.  outshone them on the price by quite a large amount this then prompted me to wait till my home insurance was due and again I got a quote which was also considerably cheaper so I have renewed with .

I am very pleased with both of my purchases and the cover that they are providing is just as good if not better on some things."
1194,good price and service - and help when needed - easy to buy - will try them for other insurance
1195,Having car insurance with  we decided to try them for Home Insurance and for directly comparable cover compared to previous cover and two others it was by far the best value. The customer service was also good in that staff were knowledgeable and able to answer queries and meet our exact needs plus make constructive suggestions. Also promptly forthcoming in sending us draft quotations so we had the opportunity to read through them without any pressure and arrive at the right and correct cover . Overall easy to deal with.
1196,"Avila along with every other insurance company I spoke to dont really get the concept of being self employed. Since it is becoming more popular I suspect that they will have to get it eventually. The idea that one-size-fits-all is incredibly outdated now. Self employed people share possessions between work and personal use - heavens even the Inland Revenue understand that. But not insurance companies.

Still I eventually got pretty well what I wanted - at quite a high premium - except some weird stuff like my laptop isnt insured in Europe (on the mainland). Why???

No other company would insure my camera because it belongs to my business but I also use it personally -  did so that was a real plus. Initially they didnt want to cover it in Europe but relented on that - hurrah!

Yes I would recommend them but be prepared for a very long conversation or two or three if you are self employed and know what you want."
1197,"This is our first time with  (I always look around for the best and cheapest insurance every year). I found the site easy to navigate and to purchase the cover we needed (I especially liked the feature of seeing how your premium is broken down). The insurance documents are easy to read and follow as well as seeming a lot shorter than most other policies Iï¿½ve seen in the past. The online policy portal is also well laid out easy to use and navigate so another bonus! We always tend to purchase the additional Personal Belongings to cover us outside the house and abroad as most travel insurance policies have an insufficient amount of personal belong cover and small valuable limits.

Overall we are very happy with the experience and understanding of what we have bought so far but I guess the real test of this would be if we ever have to use it (which is hopefully never) so until then we are very happy ï¿½ yay cue smiley face :)"
1198,I bought house insurance on line at a competitive price.
1199,I found the website easy to use and update my information as required. The product matched and beat my previous supplier.
1200,Was unable to complete online but within minutes  telephoned me and completed my cover with efficiency.
1201,what I like about  is firstly I was talking to someone based in the Scottish call centre about five miles away I had insurance on my holiday home with  and it was on the renewal that I asked about insurance on my main home and to my surprise their was a great saving so considering my existing insurer would not insure my holiday home on a Scottish island I very quickly decided to have both homes with  and I will take out car insurance with them also well done  your now top and I will tell all my friends
1202,when looking for a motorcycle insurance quote the gentleman I spoke to was very helpful although it was not right for me at the time. when the quote was over the gentleman brought it to my attention that they also did home insurance and he gave me a quote. When my home insurance became due for renewal I rang up and took out my home insurance with .
1203,Found it very easy to a just to what I needed. Will look to get a quote when its time to renew.
1204,"I bought my car insurace from  that was very competatively priced and easy to buy.
The same applied to insuring my home and its contents very easy to buy a good bit cheaper than most others. All in all I am very happy with the whole process. I did have the need to call the helpline the young man I spoke to was most helpful and soon explained the part I was having difficulties with.
I will certainly recommend  to all my friends Thankyou."
1205,very helpful prompting and understanding one or two particular aspects of my requirements
1206,insurance cover all my needs and was able to talk to customer services to clear up a few details excellent service from them thanks.
1207,"We insured our cars last year with  and when our household insurance was due for renewal I went on-line for a quote. The quote was extremely competitive. I had some extra requirements so telephoned through to discuss them. The customer service I received was very professional.

I highly recommend !"
1208,Request dealt with promptly sensibly and without any funny language. As the saying goes it does what it says on the tin.
1209,"Great customer service help. Policy gives more than most of us will never need. Really easy and very happy
And the bonus was i saved a few quid aswell:-)"
1210, is among the most cost effective Fortunately I have never had to make a claim.
1211,"When the insurer I had used for a few years upped the premiums by much more than inflation I decided to look elsewhere (as I had already done with my car insurance) and  was the best of the several companies I surveyed. The online procedures were straightforward and a subsequent telephone query was answered quickly.
Overall a slick professional operation offering similar benefits at significant savings."
1212,"My experience with  insurance has been first class so much so that i have already recommended two friends to give you a chance at quoting for home contents and buildings.
I did all my dealings online with no problem whatsoever  i am 81 yrs old.
An excellent service well done ."
1213,I saved a fortune for the same cover. Everything was so easy all online no hassle at all.
1214,My car insurance has been with  for many years so when I received the phone regarding the rewal of my Building and Contents I thought why not and see whay they can offer. I found the whole process from start to finish was very simple and the additional free features are very impressive. Overall I have saved money and have a much better level of cover including emergency call out.
1215,credit given where credits due to  good all round insurance for everything no need to go any where else for your insurance its all here at  full value for money
1216,"My first time with  The customer service was very good and good
Value for money.
And would recommend  to any friends."
1217,"I was amazed at the price  quoted especially as compared with my previous insurer and the cover that insurer offered.  was able to lower the price lower the excess improve buildings cover considerably and include accidental damage although this is limited. I purchased my policy via the internet which was a simple process and at the price originally quoted. Also the policy documents are available to access on line rather than receive them by post with the then added problem of storing them safely.

I hope the same service and renewal pricing continues next year."
1218,As I have only recently changed my house insurance to  I can only comment on the service I received when purchasing the policy. I found it to be excellent value and much less than others I tried. If I have a criticism it is that I have not yet received the promised vouchers for taking out the policy - can take up to 30 days and I have had the cover for 26 days perhaps I am being too impatient but overall no complaints. Also have my car insurance with  and again excellent service and no complaints.
1219,I have just purchased house and contents insurance by monthly direct debit online. Its early days yet but overall my experience is good and so is the price. I did need to telephone once to clarify one point and was well treated by a young man with an English accent. Boom Boom
1220,Already have my car insurance with  and now they also have my contents insurance as they delivered the cheapest quote from a top company.
1221,"I contacted  to get a quote for home insurance. The female dealing with my enquiry led me through the process and took time to allow me to compare my existing provider cover to ensure I got the policy which exactly met my needs. I did not feel any pressure to purchase at any time. I felt valued and listened to and it was as if I was speaking to a friend rather than someone out to sell me a product.
My new policy gives me better cover than my previous one and I also have the added benefit of legal cover and no claims protection.
I received my paperwork through the post within a few days and everything is in order. I am very satisfied with all the service I received."
1222,The friendly helpful approach used far outweighs the heavy-handed selling techniques used by many of your competitors. The policy offers better value in its content and overall better value for money than the popularly named company I used last year that barks loudly. I hope you can maintain these standards and that I do not have to go searching again next year because of an untoward price rise.
1223,i found the web site very clear and straightforward everything was explained well. I was pleased with the price and the service and it was a nice bonus to learn of s policy to replace my front door locks if I was burgled.
1224,Found the home insurance very good value for money compared to other insurers. Very friendly and helpful staff. Had to ring to ask why policy had not been sent in post this was a misunderstanding as had obtained quotation from internet and they did then send us a copy in the post. Also the telephone number I was given if we had any questions about the policy was the wrong number but overall we are pleased with this product.
1225,from the first quote to the last line on the form i found the experience an easy way to compare and complete. everything was explained and there were no hidden costs so the price shown was the price i paid. i would certainly use them again and recommend them to friends and relatives.
1226,When I got our household and contents quotes was pleased that  had bettered our previous long standing insurer and also how close they were to others.
1227,I found the service given very helpful and feel that I have received a good product for a very fair price.
1228,A painless quotation and documents available immediately. Very competitive price too. A reliable branded company too.
1229,was looking on line for home insurance  was a go price was looking at a other site  rang me and gave me a better price and up graded my policy great customer service. Thanks
1230,I had tried to renew my contents insurance with my old company and the lady at the call centre was so blunt uninterested and made it clear that I had interupted something a lot more interesting that I decided to take my pounds elsewhere. The  lot were charming helpful and the same price for ï¿½10000 more cover. A painless and pleasant experience.
1231,A very good all-encompassing policy which was easy to set up. The whole transaction was accomplished with ease and professionalism thankyou.
1232, house insurance is of the highest standard for a really low price. Would recommend  to everyone.
1233,"Im already an  customer and wasnt surprised when their house insurance was the best value for money and provided great cover
The quote was easily obtained and the website experience was smooth"
1234,The Advisor I spoke to was very helpful and took time to ensure I understood every aspect of the policy before I went ahead. I was more than happy with the quote I received.
1235,When purchasing my home insurance I was surprised by the helpful and very good advise I received from the representative there was no pushing or rushing they gave me good advise and there opinions on what was the best procedure and most competitive price available for my insurance Cover. When any of my family have there home or car insurance due I will most definitely recommend  Insurance cover. We have now insured our cars with  at a very competitive price Than You.
1236,I have my car buildings and contents insurance with  and this meant that the price quoted was considerably cheaper than their competitors while the cover is very good. Satisfied customer :-)
1237,"We changed our house insurance to  after changing our car insurance
earlier in the year. An excellent product at a very good price. A very happy
customer."
1238,"There is nothing much to add the service is always excellent as you would
expect from one of the largest insurance companys around very competitive pricing over a wide range of products always my first contact
when I want insurance."
1239,"downloaded policy but no contact phone numbers .
this is the reason for only 4 star"
1240,"It is a painstaking experience but one where you learn that it pays to shop around.I usually like to get about four main suppliers not including the current supplier and make comparisons with all .On this years policy which had not changed in any way my current suplier had increased by about 12 %.but that had been for two years in a row.In 2012 I had stayed with them as they responded and came in line with my best quote.The 2013 quote I decided that they were not competitve and switched to .
The  team responded wellwere polite knowlegable and helpful in all areas understanding there product and helpful with several areas where I needed certain items to be covered both in and out of home..
I am very pleased and now look forward to some good quotes with the cars."
1241,"Did the on line chat which I found helpful. After going through every thing I phoned them to make sure I hadnt missed any thing. So far so good.
Only thing I didnt like was getting all the reminders some times up to 3 in a day telling me the quote was still available when I had already agreed and paid for it. Got to be to much so I phoned and asked why????"
1242,i bought house and content insurece from  as you would except from any insurance company  they will bend over backward to get youre premium but the real acid test will be when a claim is made will they act quickly and officantly to resolve youre claim or will they drag there feet and try to wiggle they way out of it. onlt time will tell
1243,I will have to change companies as it seems that all companies offer a first year discount.
1244,"I decided to purchase our home insurance through you as the house we were considering to purchase was originally built in a coal mining area and  were named in one of the reports from the Coal Board.
The sale fell through and presumably the house we next choose when we move to North Yorkshire may have a similar specification.

It is hoped that we will not need to claim but if we do I will be in a better position to review our purchase through ."
1245,"This was the first time that I found an easy to use online site that allowed me to easily specify the options and extras I needed. The simplicity also beat the heck out of the endless questions you have when getting quotes over the phone.
I was really pleased with the service and the price.
I would recommend the online service."
1246,Easy to amend any part of the insurance requirements. Very competitive price and also nice to talk to an English person on the helpline.
1247,"Easy to compare quotes and to include or exclude additional services as required.
Included everything I needed and simple to do online."
1248,...up to now. Easy to understand and to purchase with good customer service. Initially explored comparison sites and recieved a follow up call from  after talking to the adviser I went ahead with the purchase of home and buildings policy at a good reduction in price from my previous policy having already taken out motor insurance with them some time ago I felt quite confident. Good experience and only time will tell if this remains to be so. Unfortunately the only blip is that I cant review my policies under one account as apparently they were both put into separate accounts initially and  dont appear to have the facility / ability to rectify this so I must have two accounts two passwords etc? !
1249,"I was very pleased with the way I was able to negotiate the siteand quite clearly able to see exactly what I was purchasing.I had one query which was quickly answered via the availability to have a one to one on line question and answer session with a sales person who was confident and very reassuring.
Wish all companies were as competent as "

Got the same cover for loads less than I had been paying.
Agent was very knowledgeable friendly and informative."
1251,Great service  were very helpful with my home insurance also got a discount for having car insurance with them would certainly recommend
1252,We had been with another company for many years but were getting no benefits and the price kept going up. We decided to go online with  but needed to ask questions. We got through to a pleasant customer service agent who went through the details with us. Very good value for money.
1253,"Insurance renewal time. Renewal letter arrives. Easy to simply renew. This year I read some of the conditions - not happy phoned last insurance company - correct and not very helpful.
Tried  on the net. Unsure of a few things and phoned - very helpful indeed. Great service and an OK price. What more can you ask for."
1254,Whilst shopping around for some contents insurance  turned out to be the cheapest not by miles but every penny counts. I have not called  to claim or anything but the process of purchasing online etc was straight forward.
1255,I already have my car insurance with avivia and no problems with it. Just taken out a house policy all done over the phone and not at my expense very very cheap and all the benefits I did shop around but could not be beaten on price.
1256,Quick and easy insurance cover at a competative rate. No hard sell but plenty of information when required. A great customer experience in a short time. Thank you.
1257,I did the usual search for comparison sites and noticed Avivia. The were less than half of the other sites had looked at and with better policy. Covers everything I need for Buildings and Contents. I did the quote several times to make sure the price quoted was correct and it came out the same every time. Very pleased with the price.
1258,I hope to have no experience of making a claim under the policy but choosing what I wanted and needed was simple and the levels of cover could be amended and updated.
1259,As a retired Staff member my loyalty remains with  but only if the price is right.For both my Car & House insurance the price was extremely competitive
1260,Good value and easy process to follow. Prompt receipt of documengs.
1261,I am new to  home insurance but my experience so far has been good. It is good value for money and the purchase went smoothly. I could pick up the phone and talk to helpful members of staff who explained everything in detail.
1262,"The People on the other end of the phone were helpful and polite

what a change that made for a start and the quote was quickly

given and accepted ."
1263,"The price for renewal with my existing insurer had increased by 60% with no apparent justification..
The property is on a hill I am over 60 have not made a claim in the 23 years that I have lived there and therfore consider myself to be a low risk.
I already had an  motor policy with more than 10 years without a claim so the  home insurance policy was not only cheaper than the competition but easy to set up online."
1264,Searched for better household insurance and found the  can out top I have halved my premium.
1265,Initially I was able to follow the on-line application easily but making a mistake was not easy to correct after submitting it. However ringing the help number was incredibly helpful and they were able to re-do the application with the necessary corrections to complete it. This took a little time but I was totally satisfied with the end result!
1266,I tried to purchase online however website was down due to maintenance. I purchased by telephone they matched the online price also it was good to speak to a British call centre!!
1267,I found this quote very reasonable i have been with  for years with our multi car insurance and thought I would ask for a quote on house insurance the quote was very good i have saved a good amount of money will recommend anyone to ask for a quote.
1268,"Very good user friendly web site. Completing application was simple and quote was received very promptly.

Cover offered was excellent and much better than my previous policy. Great value for money offering a wide range of cover and suggestions on things to cover I had not thought about.

I would recommend  to anyone who is looking for renewal or first time purchases of insurance."
1269,I have been looking for inexpensive car and home insurance and was introduced to  by a friend.The customer service was very good indeed with a no pressure approach I was able to get both products to suit my needs at an affordable price with all documentation sent online.I would recommend  to all you will save money but not at the expense of a quality product.
1270,"Compared to my previous insurers my home and contents insurance  definatley take home the trophy There was no confusing sale garb and no hassle from the agent. I had already switched over my motor insurance so i was absoloutly delighted with the premium i was offered.

In the past i have been badly advised and have taken on unnessesary insurance with  i made the decisions and they provided the cover i decided was best for me.

I would recommend all of my friends to make a comparison with  and i am sure they would agree with me  are the leaders in Insurance."
1271,"I had taken car insurance in November and was keen to compare
Price for home and contents with a as very pleased with
Value I had for car insurance. I was amazed to be offered comprehensive cover with all features to allow me confidence
With product. My next need is holiday insurance of course I
Will go straight for an  quote and anticipate taking their product. I am not usually confident with on line purchases as I usually prefer personnel contactagain surprised myself with
The ease of my experience. Go on and try for yourself."
1272,I am now insured with  for my Home insurance and my car insurance their customer service team are helpful and professional. I called them as i couldnt find the answer to my querry on the internet and they went through everything with me to make sure i had all the information needed to complete my purchase of home insurance. I would definitely recommend  to my friends.
1273,Good value but cannot find the policy to print out?
1274,"Comparison sites are where I go for my insurance and then try 1 or 2 Companies that arent on comparison sites.

Have previously got quotes from  and always found them expensive but not this time. They were much cheaper by far than other Companies.

What I also found really great about  is their onliine chat service.

I needed confirmation on a couple of things and used the chat service. Ive used these on other sites but found them useless because its automated and they dont understand what youre asking.

s online chat is with a live person and its fast and accurate.

I recommend everyone looking for insurance to try ...I love their ads too!"
1275,As an existing car insurance customer with  it was easy to compare their home insurance with the rest of the market. Overall the policy details wee in line or better than most of the competion.
1276,We were first introduced to  with my husbands pension. Since then we have had car insurance an d now house insurance and never have had a problem. It was easy to complete house insurance quote on line and we are kept informed regularly about the little extras you can get with . I even won some rugby tickets once! Excellent company excellent service.
1277,I have returned to  as I feel that I am able to get the cover needed without having to read pages of small print.
1278,Very good product detailed well you get what you ask for and more the product covers everything you need to be covered great in many ways would recommend to any one
1279,Excellent Insurance for my requirements.Would certainly use  again.
1280,"Having seen the  advert I decided to explore their Home Insurance and found it to be very comparable to the Insurance I had last year so decided to take it up.

Hopefully I have done the right thing. Only time will tell."
1281,"I found the  website very easy to use and the various policy extras easy to choose.
The price was not the cheapest but very competitive and value for what was included in the final cost plus  is a well known company."
1282,I thought I had a good deal last year but I was tempted to get a quote from  because they offered me a discount on home insurance after taking out car insurance with them. This proved an even better deal. I signed up on line which was easy but on querying something a helpful member of staff pointed out something else which I should have included. This cost a bit more but was still less than last years quote from my previous provider. I am well pleased.
1283,i recently took out home insurance and was very pleased with the service i received from . it was easy and fast to complete i would recommend anyone to use  in the future.
1284,helpful sales person just what was needed with monthly payments very satisfying transaction
1285,"From start to finish the process was easy friendly human and clear. The person on the end of the phone was happy to answer any questions I had and go over any points that werent clear as often as I needed to.

I cant praise their customer service enough. For once calling a central sales line was a pleasant experience that left me smiling at the end of it."
1286,"My previous insurer who I had been with for over 14 years (and only made two claims over that period) quoted an exhorbitant premium which made me look around.
I searched for an alternative but did not want to go through a comparrison site and  had a good reputation and easy to follow web site.
Thank goodness I made the change exactly the same cover to the very last detail but far more competitive."
1287,I contacted  for my home insurance the service was excellent and the process of buying was painless and the documents arrived the next day. I would recommend dealing with  as the are very professional
1288,The overall experience from Completing details on line to having to phone customer services about a query was easy and quick. The disapppointment came when having to do the over kill survey.
1289,"I reckon the ratings Ive given the product speaks for itself.
I began to complete the policy on-line but I had a few queries a sales representative phoned me to offer his assistance and the very helpful and polite gentleman assisted me in completing the policy by making sure I had the cover required to my best needs for this Im truly grateful."
1290,I like being able to add on extras and the explanations of if I needed them or not was very helpful
1291,Great value I just hope it is as good in the following years.
1292,Having saved money on my car insurance with  it made good sense to go with them for our house insurance my  quote was cheaper than the one I was using.
1293,I found no pushy salespersons with the sale of the policy and this was very much noticed. Good approach by staff.
1294,We have been policyholders for 10+ years: Easy to renew on line. We have had no occasion to make a claim so cannot say whether the policy is value for money
1295,Experience so far really good not giving 5 stars as dont know how it will work out should I need to make a claim
1296,I needed home content insurance looked on line and decided to go with  their prices were really competitive their site was really easy to understand and navigate around which is really important for me as I am not the best person with computers the only problem I had was setting up a password so rang the helpline number (free phone) it was answered within minutes and the young man was really helpful in sorting it out I could understand him clearly he was friendly and nothing seemed any trouble so yes I would recommend !
1297,Bit better than my previous insurer. Waiting to see about how things go when it is time for renewal - that is when insurers really \try it on\.
1298,Web and phone purchase made easy with s staff being very helpfully.
1299,My experience of  has been a long one and I have not bought their products for a few years. Recent Board-level changes have impressed and the multi-talented actor who has performed in the progression of advertisements has amused me. Having already looked at price-comparison sites I telephoned for a quote direct from . Not only was the price very competitive the application was easy to complete and seemed to have all the features I require.
1300,"Quick and easy quote provided and compared well with the my previous cover. Slightly cheaper than my previous provider.
This is not the cheapest policy but cover includes a lot more in coparison to other cheaper quotes.
Also  is well established with a good reputation.
I would recommend to anyone to consider future cover."
1301,"I compared this insurance term for terms with my existing company who then tried to match  but could not. This in itself made  the most competitive pricing.
Delighted with how my enquiry for personally handled by knowledgable and efficient people.
I have my car insurance with  also and would not now go anywhere else and highly recommend others to use Avivs"
1302,this is exactly the insurance that i required saved a lot of time searching through different providers
1303,Not had to make a claim yet which is the ultimate test of any insurance policy but so far so good. The policy is comprehensive in its range of cover and I could find nothing in the fine print to suggest there was anything being hidden or excluded that you would expect to be there. In fact there were some features like cover for our daughter whilst at Uni that I hoped for but didnt expect. The price is very reasonable too and compares favourably with similar cover from other respected providers . There are always cheaper options but with names I have never heard of so I stay away. Would definitely recommend.
1304,The whole process was very easy and straight forward the questions were sensible and easy to answer. The only problem I had was that after purchase I still got e-mails saying my quote was still active. This made me think that something might have gone wrong despite the confirmation e-mail. I am glad I paid the small amount extra to get it all in writing. I tend to find that I change supplier every year as the premiums always seem to increase substantially after the first year. It would make the quote even more attractive if it were for a number of years with only an inflationary increase.
1305,The whole process was very easy and straight forward the questions were sensible and easy to answer. The only problem I had was that after purchase I still got e-mails saying my quote was still active. This made me think that something might have gone wrong despite the confirmation e-mail. I am glad I paid the ï¿½3 extra to get it all in writing. I tend to find that I change supplier every year as the premiums always seem to double after the first year. It would make the quote even more attractive if it were for a number of years with only an inflationary increase.
1306,Easy access great coverage and an amazing low price!
1307,Best deal I found on line I have motor insurance with 
1308,"Firstly I have 2 cars insured with  on a joint policy for 2 years now. Last year nobody could touch their price (dont bother with comparison websites). Again this year nobody could come close. To make things even better I got an extra 20% discount off my car insurance because I have my home insurance and 30% extra off my home insurance because I have my cars insured with them.
Now their home policy wasnt the cheapest however I had every conceivable extra which didnt quite make a level playing field for comparison purposes but all things being equal with the 30% discount applied it was VERY competitive.
The peace of mind comes in because I am dealing with an insurance company and not a broker. You will see the benefit of this if you ever have to make a claim."
1309,"This was the best value for the cover we required and dealt with our needs.

Only one issue the 1.5% charge for a credit card I expect this exceeded the cost of adminestering and under new legislation this might not be fair.
It only came up when I was paying for the product I could have paid by a Debit ard and I would expect it cost no more to adminester."
1310,Great sevice took policy direct this time not through broker as cheaper and no silly admin fee for renewing. Avila understand the needs for my property as local to norfolk namely clay lump construction normal for old properties. Not too many silly questions just straight forward easy process.
1311,"A Very good service
Also very helpful on twitter would recommend them to all my friends and family best quotes where from  on car insurance and home insurance"
1312,A lot cheaper than my renewal policy is like for like of my previous years  so all appears to be a good buy.
1313,"Great quote but when taking up insurance the amount payable did not match the original quote. Therefore had to phone to take up at quoted premium.
Customer service very good when I telephoned and ensured I paid the correct lower premium in accordance with the emailed quote."
1314,"My buildings and contents insurance was due to be renewed at a cost of over ï¿½X monthly. When I mentioned this to my family they were astonished so I decided to try elsewhere.  had already cut the annual cost of my car insurance by over ï¿½X and it even went down the following year so it seemed to be a good place to start.

The representative to whom I spoke over the phone was very friendly but it was somewhat annoying that he kept having to refer my case to a higher authority. All told the proceedings took about an hour. The written documentation contained errors.

In the end however it was worth it as the annual cost was cut by somewhere around ï¿½X.

Of course insurance is only good if it meets your needs and the real test will be if I ever have to make a claim. Obviously I hope this will not happen but only time will tell.

In conclusion I would like to say that the rule in writing these reviews that reference to specific prices or amounts saved seems to be pointless."
1315,My Pension wifes car insuarnce are both with  so l have placed my Home Insurance with  - why not they are excellent.
1316,This is another product I have purchased from . The customer service and value for money is fantastic. The more products you have with them the better the discounts and value. I would definitely recommend  to anyone.
1317,Website easy to use and to read the policy benefits.
1318, not only undercut my previous insurer but also gave better cover which was tailored to suit our needs!!
1319,"Car insurance renewal was fine with query leading to reduction in premium.
Renewing two home insurances proved more problematic as change from just paying monthly to paying annually oddly and unnecessarily required change of policy number! I was assured that the same policy conditions would apply to the new policy number; this was NOT the case and caused considerable effort in sorting out but with a review next year although I had the policy with CU then NU then  for over 30 years and no change of property and not a single claim! (I would not have changed my well-working policy and been willing to pay the small charge for monthly interest to avoid this hassle).
Otherwise I have been happy with CU/NU/ for the past 45 years!"
1320,Every member of staff I spoke to regarding my insurance was very helpful and gave me all the information I needed. I also got a good deal because I bought both my life insurance and home insurance with . Would definately recommend to a friend.
1321,"Was able to purchase my home contents insurance and speak to an advisor who helped me make sure I had the correct cover. Web site was easy to use and login and see your documents. Price seemed very competitive.
If the experience was to be replicated in the event of a claim then it would be a first class product and company."
1322,"Great experience for us.
My wife was particlularly impressed with the simple plain language of our policy.
Far better than our previous insurance suppliers and will move all insurances to  now."
1323,"My husband inherited his family home following the death of his mother and as we need to renovate it prior to moving in we needed insurance for an unoccupied property.

We contacted the insurers who had previously covered the house but found their premium to be ridiculously high bearing in mind its history and level of contents (practically none).

I rang  as they cover our existing home and was delighted by the service.

The agent took minimal details to allow her to quickly check with the underwriters and then once they agreed to give cover she went through all the information needed.

As we have five years NCD on our own home this was extended to the new house. Cover for falling trees was included as standard (unlike the other insurer referred to above) which we need as the new house has several trees in the garden.

The agent was pleasant helpful and cheerful. The policy was tailored to suit us regarding cover and excesses and I could not have be happier."
1324,Straightforward to complete however initial price is greatly increased when you add in what I would consider to be standard parts of the product ie no claims protection.
1325,After reviewing lots of insurance policies this one could not be beaten for price or product. Very easy to use website would and have recommended to others
1326,Points discussed in formulating policy quotation were clearly dealt with and resultant quotation covered my requirements conpletely.
1327,NO frills NO nonsense just good honest people selling good honest insurance
1328,Unusual insurance request was dealt with extremely efficiently.The telephone representative went the extra mile to ensure we were satisfied with the extras that we needed
1329,I find the website excellent and has an easy navigation system. I also like the pop-up information that is provided with the ?
1330,Great service and savings - multi insurance for cars and home worked well for me. good phone service and clear explanations from customer service operators.
1331,Was easy to buy and documents arrived very promptly. Would definitely recommend the service and compares well with my former insurers.
1332,"I have recently take up House Insurance with  and can honestly say the customer service was the best I have experienced when purchasing any insurance. The advisers that I spoke to were knowlegable friendly and seemed genuinely interested in me and my requirements.

Having received a renewal qoute from my previous insurers that was twice what Id paid previously  were able to offer me a far better deal for the same product.

Not only that but also on receiving my policy documents I realised the paperwork was far clearer to understand than Id previously had. All in all a very good service and I will definitely be back for my other insurance products as the come up for renewal."
1333,Everything was made so easy.Was pleased that everything was in order from the start. Makes a nice change from some
1334,Excellent value easy purchase even moved my car insurance
1335,"The company has good and easy to view terms and conditions
easy to alter various conditions and see the different changes in prices they create.
The on line service is excellent and there is also the telephone service if it is required.
The fact that if you have various other insurances with the company then they usually offer better terms and conditions with the insurance that is being discussed."
1336,I am totally satisfied with the savings I have made
1337,Was surprised how much cover I got for such a low payment compared to previous company I was with. The representative on the live chat was excellent went through everything with me to ensure I hadnt forgot anything . I stated a timne for a ring back to set up the policy and I was rung on time which is a first so was impressed with evrything and everyone concerned at .
1338,"I chose to go on line to renew my household insurance. One can choose any option of cover you require and it is all made easy on line. Explanations and options are given every step of the way through your purchase. I will use  Direct for my car insurance cover when it comes up for renewal.

I liked this product for the options and choices of cover.
The only thing I disliked about the product was there was a charge shown on screen for the certicate and documents to be sent out to the customer by post. I just think it should be sent out as a right and free. However it is an excellant product."
1339,Very competetive premium. Excellent service from the advisor at Glasgow call centre. High recommendation.
1340,A great product at a great price. The best quote we could get. Made us change from our present home insurer who could not get anywhere near s quote!
1341,Excellant price AND cash bck too! The internet site was brilliant. Most importantly the cover is all I need. I have saved more than I thought possible as I got what I thought was a good deal last year but  beat it. I also enjoy the support service and the great offfers that come withbeing a customer. Free tickets to the opening matches of the  premiership rugby season were so appreciated. Discount on more products is something I will be taking up as policies come up for renewal. Over all I am so impressed with . Well done
1342,I HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH THE INSURANCE THAT i TOOK OUT FOR MY FLAT. HAVE RECOMMENDED TO MY FRIENDS
1343,Great price great service and easy to buy over the internet was easier to see exactly what I was getting for my money than most other websites i had tried before.
1344,Having got good value with car insurance I was pleased home insurance was also competitive.
1345,What I felt was a complicated situation was made so much simpler by the efficient and courteous staff who attended to me. I felt so relieved having \got things sorted\ and at such a reasonable price too. Thanks to  and their friendly team.
1346,"I found the whole experience in dealing with  much easier less taxing and not at all confusing when compared to comparison web sites I would thoroughly recommend  to others.
The process took approx 15 minutes and each policy area was explained in detail in order to fully understand what was being purchased."
1347,Very good experience
1348,I looked at many insurance companies and found that because we have an item that fell outside the single item price range we were un insureable whereas  gave us a larger range we were able to itemise the piece whilst keeping the total package affordable. We were advised by another insurance company to sell the item in question so that they could insure us??
1349,"One would point out that the  web site is the worse web site one could visit.
It was only after I had phoned (Using a FREE phone number) to let  know that their web site was rubbish that a very polite and I would suspect young lady phoned to apologize for the problems with the web and offing me a deal that I found fair and reached all my requirements that I change from my usual insurer to  .
I can make no other observation as regards  other than to say the cover appears very good and the price very reasonable.
As we have never made a claim one can not give a judgement as to the service given by .
Sorry to say that the field \Would you recommend\  was mandatory and as i was going to leave blank  is the reason for me putting NO. This question should be asked when next years renewal is due. This also applies to the rating I have given This also applies to the rating I have given"
1350,Most helpful and informative customer service and excellent value for money. Thanks so much
1351,I was trawling through other sites for quotes and wasnt having much joy when I thought of that Italian guy on the advert \straight to \. I was able to customise the cover  excess etc and had completed the transaction in seconds  fantastico!
1352,Easy to understand and simple to use with a great price to finish with.
1353,Applied for quotation on line and was pleased with price quoted I had a query re the contents element. Discussed this with a advisor who then asked if I had any other  products said I had pension and price was further reduced. I can guarantee I could not get a better price anywhere. Would recommend to anyone at the very least get a quote.
1354,"Quick to phone but 2 weeks after purchase and still no documents by either email or post. Not very good customer service!!
Wont be renewing home or motor."
1355,Gave me what I required at good value but kept getting anoying quote reminders even AFTER I had purchased
1356,I always purchase my Home & Contents Insurance online. I found `s website self explanatory and easy to do. The only thing that I did struggle with and this maybe my own fault is that I could not set up the policy for the date I required.
1357,"We had been with our previous insurer for over 30 years they kept increasing the price with no obvious increase in benefit they just did not seem to care assuming we would stay with them as we had for so long. We felt it was time to look at some alternatives.

We looked at 3 alternavites finding  to be helpful and practical from the first word we got a first quote made a few changes to the cover needed got a new quote which was still a good saving for good cover.
The young lady we spoke to was helpful polite & practical.

Just like with all insurance one hopes never to have to make a claim but we feel  understood our needs when we bought the cover so will understand our needs if we do ever have to place a claim."
1358,Great price beat everyone else and offers everything that we need to cover all of our property and belongings.
1359,I looked round various sites and called a couple and these offered the best value for money for the tye of home insurace that we were after also the cheapest with the lowest access rate.
1360,no problems  purchased on line was a doddle to do compared to others.
1361,Always received excellent service on both motor and household feels safe with regard to any future problems
1362,Very reasonable price and no hassle. Even I found it very easy to complete.
1363,Great company great service....on call whenever you need them low competitive prices with a great selection of policies.
1364,The process of buying home insurance was easily completed. All elements of the total product were given with the cost quickly established.
1365,Competitive price (substantially cheaper than existing cover) clear details of cover instant quotes with minimum input \painless process\  policy documents available for immediate down-load
1366,Could check out the options on line with ease and decide it was suitable and good value then progress to completing the transaction. Found that a date had been incorrectly typed and overlooked phoned up and explained. It was rectified almost immediately. Would recommend.
1367,Great and simple apart from doing review which you have to write sixteen words
1368,I found the website easy to use and informative. The level of cover was comparative to many other more expensive companies . The quote provided was immediate precise and in plain English . Another reason for choosing  for home insurance was the positive experiance of insuring my and my wifes car with them . I have no experiance of the claim process which is the real test but hope I never have to use it ! To date my overall impresion is of a very positive and proffessional companythatis customer focused
1369,"I approached  because they did me a good deal on my pension annuity. My current home insurance company tries it on every year with silly increases - almost as if it was to see if you had noticed.

This year I went onto the  website and got more insurance for less premium. When the documents came through there was a minor addition I wanted so I phoned. The phone was answered immediately and the change was made.

All a very promising start."
1370,"all done online so no actual human contact. I was surprised to see that the
premium was deducted before the policy took effect."
1371,"Being satisfied with our cars insurances I looked into transferring our home & contents insurance to . The on-line research was straightforward and the subsequent telephone contact was relatively problem-free - the only minor point was that I was promised a return call which did not materialise and I had to intiate the follow-up.

However overall Im happy with s constructive assistance and value for money and they would be my first port of call should I need insurances in the future."
1372,I sought a quote after my regular insurance has crept steadily up in recent years and was very pleased with the price and cover provided. The only query I have (which I am currently waiting for an answer from ) is that it mentions it will save my card details to take next years premium and I may not want to renew with them next year. Whilst I know I have the option to cancel there is always the possibility of an overlap.
1373,A good deal on house insurance but  where a little too eager as even after I was sold a policy I was still getting reminders to take out a policy! I thought this was a little unprofessional to say the least.
1374,I have had car insurance with  [also my wife] for many years. On the one occasion we had to make a claim the customer service was straight forward and excellent. The repair work was to a high standard. Also the online documents are clear and easy to understand. We hope the house insurance policy will operate to the same high standards as the car insurance
1375,Excellent policy with the right amount of cover for the right price. Highly recommended to give  a try.
1376,The online experience was fairly straightforward when completing myself. Had various e-mails stating that I could take up the offering even after I had actually signed up which was slightly misleading/annoying. Also they seemed to show the initial offer. I also received a voice call which came about I assumed from an issue I had created when completing the quote. It was an errouneous call asking my to take up the offer however I had taken up the policy?
1377,My only problem to complete the purchase of my recent home @ contents policy was the endless attempts to pay with a card  after which Ihad to phone to complete the purchase . At all times staff have been most helpful  so will hope for an affordable renuable car insurance too !
1378,Looking for reasonable motor insurance last year after typical hike by my then insurer  offered extremely competetive rates for both our cars so when the same thing happened for homes and contents insurance  once again came up trumps.
1379,I was contacted soon after obtaining an online quote and requested a call back in a couple of days time. This allowed me time to consider other quotes and ensure I was choosing the right level of cover. I didnt feel pressured. I was able to go through various options before finalising. Quick efficient (and patient) service.
1380,Easy to use website offers what I need and was easy to move from step A to step B and pay - would use again
1381,"I found a telephone rep very helpful so I was able to choose the cover I needed quite easily.
I also found your Premiums very competitive.
Overall it was good.
Thank You"
1382,I recently purchased my second insurance policy via . I asked for a quote online and as it was so much lower than the quote from my previous policy I decided to leave it temporarily so I could check it out. Later the same day I received a telephone call from one of s agents. He was very helpful answered all my queries even went through my previous policy item by item to make sure that I had everything covered. He confirmed that my new policy was the same (I think even better) than my previous policy so I purchased it there and then saving myself a large amount of money. I will certainly be dealing with  in the future.
1383,"I phones  on a Sunday a couple of weeks ago to get a price for house insurance. We have been with existing insurer for over 25 years but the price was going up and up.

I got a fantastic quote and happily went ahead."
1384,I gave all my details on-line and was informed that I would receive the necessary paperwork by post in the near future. I have not yet received any paperwork
1385,Very simple website to navigate - made buying my house insurance easy. Showed me exactly what the policy covered and has a what if facility to show the increase/decrease in premiums for add ons which I found very useful
1386,price for home insurance is very good and hard to beat.
1387,Saved money when compared to renewal quote from previous insurer
1388,"Was unsure of changing companies but really pleased that I have.

Far better insurance coverage tailored to individual requirements than blanket policies with silly caps on.

Best staff not afraid to \find out\ from understanding supervisors who must have heard it all before Good experience Highly recommended"
1389,Obtained quote on-line for house and contents insurance was then able to speak to a person to verify that my policy contained all that I required. The customer service provided by  was second to none and gave me reassurance that my policy cover was as anticipated. Friendly helpful customer service.
1390,"Having got a great deal on my car insurance I decided to try  when my House insurance came up for renewal. The customer service person was great she guided me through the options and made everything very clear. She pointed out the benefits of each section and advised where necessary. She wasnt pushy and the hole experience was a pleasure.
I was so pleased that I will be coming back to  for other products & services. So nice to be treated like a person not just another punter. Great jo please keep it up."
1391,"Poor support when using Internet based services. When there are problems it takes forever to get a response.
I was left without home cover for nearly two weeks."
1392,I chose  for its value and the fact that I could speak to a uk call centre where the level of customer care was superb. Any questions I had were answered clearly they didnt try to push any extra items that I did not want onto my policy and having used  in the past if you have any problems and need to phone the emergency call line they are there to sort you out and take the stress away from you.
1393,"I have not been able to register online. I rang a represenative upwho said she would forward the policy on to me ! Not so far.
So I have to make another call."
1394,Very competitive price and helpful no-nonsense advice from customer services.
1395,We were called back after having a minor problem online your member off staff took us through the policy details everything was made very clear we purchased the policy that fitted our needs. A slight address detail error was also corrected. We are very pleased with the whole transaction.
1396,I signed up for a household policy and was told that documents would be sent to me but so far nothing has arrived. All though the policy seems ok It would be nice to get it in writing.
1397,Thought I shop around this time when re-newing my contents insurance and as I was already with  for my car insurance I would give them a try and was pleasently suprised with the deal I got with what can only be said I got more for less the latter being cash paid for the policy.
1398,"1. Quote not emailed (had to be reminded)
2. Constant follow-up calls
3. Payment was painful - it was by phone and when I finally called to accept they couldnt find the quote. I then wasnt told there was a credit card surcharge until half-way through giving the card details
4. Policy details not sent (had to be reminded)
5. Sale and policy number not confirmed by email
6. Online experience appalling - the system has no record of my policy number and is unusable! And I am not paying  3p a minute phone charges for  to sort out THEIR problems. Why is there no email support?
7. And there is still an error on the policy document. I will just keep calling the free sales line until they get it right.

 - hopeless customer service"
1399,"Overall good package.
Let down heavily by the removal of funds from my account many weeks prior to the renewal dates of both home and car insurances. This should not happen and is unjust."
1400,We already have car insurance for 2 cars with  and phoned them to see if they would offer a competitive rate for our house and contents insurance also. The result was very positive and the price asked was significantly better than the renewal quote from our existing insurer so we signed up immediately.
1401,"I have used other websites that seem to ask confusing questions  only ask what is necessary to the particular type of insurance that you wish to take out. I like clear concise questions as it is much easier to then give clear precise answers.

Value for money is also good compared to other companies. My late father had a claim with  and they dealt with it very well bearing in mind my dad was 90 years old and very deaf so they dealt with us to make it easier for him.

All together a very good company to deal with."
1402,Excellent customer service and very happy with all products purchased.
1403,Nothing is to much trouble for the team at  and buying insurance is so simple the staff are very well trained and very knowledgeable  Great to talk to Uk based staff who are all very friendly  I now have two car policies and house insurance with  Would definately recomend to a friend.
1404,The whole operation of assessing product and price was done very easily.As an  customer already the decision to add house insurance was an easy one.
1405,It was very easy to get a quote and a fair price as well
1406,I was able to easily compare against my previous insurance to see that I was getting what I required. No problems at all with taking out my insurance with  on line. It was so easy. Im not very confident at doing things on line and instead of finding this daunting I found it to be so straight forward and quick. Im happy! and covered!!
1407,"I found my house insurance had lapsed and things were not as easy to re-instate according to other companies.

Your representative was very polite very knowledgeable and very very helpful.

Although it took around 15 minutes to sort out all the details it was very smoothly done.

At the end of my call all questions had been answered a policy which fitted my needs exactly was in place.

Service above and beyond anything I could expect."
1408,"I am always suspect of cheap quotations

 were not the cheapest by a long shot but were around the price I expected to pay with the cover I wanted & with a name I could have confidence in.

I would certainly recommend them so far"
1409,"We knew which features and benefits we needed from our policy. Some companies were not able to meet our needs but  could. We found the site easy to use and when we needed more advice there was a knowledgeable phone line operator to contact free of charge. Our policy was not only available on line but a hard copy was posted to us free of charge.
From the many companies we contacted  provided the cheapest quote and we got M&S vouchers for buying on line."
1410,Easily the cheapest and best deal offered. A comprehensive policy that covers everything I need at a very competitive price.
1411, are not on price comparison websites so very easy to assume that their prices will generally be higher However s prices are similar to most others very often for better cover and without those extras that other companies tend to add on without you realising. From experience we found that when you do make a claim the response time is immediate and everything is taken care of and the details of the claims process are clearly explained.
1412,"i was searching online for household insurance and came across 
having gone through numerous websites most of the others wanted way to much detail and i become disengaged with bothering until i came across  whilst they may not be the cheapest as i wanted a bells and whistles policy i was really pleased with the ease of quote and purchase and hope in the event of requiring to make a claim it will be a easy"
1413,The product was a great price compared to others on the market. Experience was tainted by requesting to pay monthly and without permission  took the whole amount in 1 lump sum. Not happy to say the least!!
1414,"the small print matters read/understand it before buying.....you need to be comfortable with your understanding and ask if your not ....I think what I bought is what I expected............hope I do not need it !!..... in a manner of speaking......BUT... at least I have peace of mind....what price for that?
Do not rely on comparison websites.....ok I started there but what you input does not necessarily translate across to inclusion on each quote for comparison...beware!"
1415,With pleasant personnel offering a clear and concise product it was a delight not to be \bullied\ as you seem to be on the normal Insurance on line experiences.
1416,I had worried about sorting out my insurance in the end  made it easy and saved me a lot of money.
1417,Easy to get a quote & cheapest in comparison to other companys.
1418,The lady I spoke to was most helpful and explained things very clearly and precise. The main reason I liked the product was because it was better than the product I already had.
1419,I am now satisfied not only by the pleasant manner my call is treated but most of all by any renewal premiums I receive from . It seems that now they research my premium against other companies before sending. I have no need any more to compare like for like myself.  have done all my work for me. Well done. This way you can keep GOOD Customers.
1420,For the same product I saved a lot of money on a renewal quote from my previous insurers - even though I had never made a claim and had been with them for several years! Does customer loyalty not count these days? Having said that  did a good deal as I am insured with them for my car and they deal with problems quickly efficiently and without fuss!
1421,"I recently changed my house insurance policy to  following my son in laws experience.

Acting for my son in law I called  from the roadside. He was being cut from his car following a collision and thankfully was not seriously injured. I spoke to  giving them all the details I could. The accident occurred one Saturday afternoon and by 5pm that day  informed us that they had already been in contact with both other parties and would be able to settle the claim within a few days. On Tuesday (3 days later) my son in law received a cheque for his written off car.

The service provided by  was truly outstanding. I was so impressed by the professional courteous and caring manner of service that I switched my own insurers a week later when my house policy was due for renewal.

An amazing level of service. Thank you."
1422,Found customer service exellent. What more can one say.
1423,I was very pleased to be able to take out a far superior policy compared to the one I purchased elsewhere last year and for a much cheaper price. I also have a car insurance with  which helped give me a discount on my house insurance.
1424,"The whole experience was great from start to finish the ease of being able to find exactly what you needed from your Insurance policy. I would recommend anybody to use  as a lot of the other companies i tried where not as easily understandable.

I will be telling all my friends when they need to renew to give  a try and when my other Insurance policies need renewing I will be getting quotes for there replacements."
1425,Sales team were brilliant and they called back when they said they would Cannot fault then
1426,Good value probably due to discounts from having a multi car policy with . The real test will be if the premiums shot up next year when I wil not be a new customer. This is usually the case with other insurers and I dont expect this to be any different! Only time will tell.
1427,Helpful advisor -- not too pushy! Fair price that beat the quote I received from my current insurers. Would recommend others to at least do a comparison check. Many thanks.
1428,"I have had home insurance for over 30years. I am a registered childminder and have been for the past 10 years. I have stayed with the same home insurance provider because of my business.
I decided to seek alternative quotes from various providers thinking that it would only confirm that my insurance provider was as competative as any other. Was I wrong!
I contacted  as one of my price comparisons.......it was so easy to get a quote. The representative from  was so helpful she went through everything I would need to include which was more cover than my last insurerer. I was holding my breath when she said \here is your quote\. To my amazement it was a lot cheaper than expected even with the extras on it. I got a discount for having motor insurance with  too. Definitely worth shopping around. A better product than I already had.......and a lot cheaper. Thank you for your help."
1429,I certainly feel that the product gives all of the cover required for the home. In addition I found it extremely compete ice from all other quotes.
1430, was very competive in the Market for the same type of cover
1431,Buildings and Contents insurance purchased easily via web site versatility to choose own limits and levels of cover plus ability to name individual items. Better cover found for less money so more than happy with my  experience. The real judgement however will come a year from now when my new premium is announced.
1432,Easy to buy and great help from the help line. They were able to answer an unusual question with not too long a delay and it was covered. Cover matches any other company and was cheaper too. Hope I never need to use it!
1433,Comprehensive home policy for buildings and contents with lots of flexibility to customise for individual preferences
1434,would have liked contact tel no to be a free phone one and a copy of docs to be posted to me free rather than it costing however all staff very helpfull so far so good
1435,I did a search on line and this I found the quickest and best option. They then phoned me and talked me through things which were very exceptable.
1436,When our old polcy was up for renewal we decided to do some shopping around to see what else was out there and found  to be offering the best value for money policy. The overall experience from the quotation to the purchase was very positive. Would recommend to anybody
1437,EXCELLENT INSURANCE DEAL. WITH ALL THE INCREASES IN INSURANCES IT WAS GREAT TO STILL BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY WITHOUT LOSING OUT ON QUALITY OF SERVICE. AND COVER. SO FAR I WOULD RECOMMEND GIVING  A GO.
1438,Having just lost my mother I needed to check the policy for more than 30 days unoccupied house insurance period The team at  were very helpful at such a sad time and made me feel valued as a customer would recommend their service to anyone.
1439,I was very happy with all of the services I was offerd.
1440,I recieved my renewal from another Company which was very competetive and I did not think I would get lower. However  was cheaper and offered very good cover for my home.It was easy to purchase on line.
1441,value for money when compred with other companies.
1442,This was one of the best services I have had we had a local company quote which was far more expensive and not a very good service. I contacted  and they were very helpful even after I had made the application on line would I recommend them Yes without a doubt.
1443,Good value contents covereasy to set up good price compared to others checked out on line
1444,They beat all prices! They pull out all the stops and give you their best deal possible for you........Thanks a million!
1445,This home insurance was considerably cheaper than my current one. Although Im supposed to get a 20% discount as I have car insurance with . I cant tell if Ive received this or not thats the only part of the process that is rather obscure.
1446,For once a company where you can purchase differing levels of accidental cover! Add ons are simple to use and makes tailoring the insurance easier rather than pay for stuff you dont need.
1447,very good value for moneyno gimmicks.and very friendly staff.
1448,Excellent service ast all times no problems at all. Competitive price and  very usefully an 0800 number to ring them on . Great so far.
1449,great value for money easy to arrange on line my car insurance and my house insurance ..
1450,"Why are insurance companies insisting in making automatic renewal the standard and claimimg that it is for the customers benefit? It requires extra effort on the customers part and sometimes phone calls to decilne it. It is of no benefit to the customer who should review their policy annually as a matter of course and a major benefit to the insurance company as the renewal premium is usually higher that one can get by looking around - even if you stay with the same company.
As a minimum the default should be that is it not included and a tick box can be provided for those who wish to take up this facility.
Unfortunately  is no better than the rest on this issue."
1451,I would recomend  home insurance to anyone who wants agood deal.
1452,I was very impressed and hope that the company service will be as promised and exceeds my expectations.
1453,I created an on line quote and then was bombarded with emails and phone calls to my mobile whilst at work. When i asked to be left alone and i would call back when i was ready i was told oh well if you dont want to save money. The day i called the person who assisted me was courteous and the insurance was purchased. I now appear though not be able to get the documentation from  either by email or hard copy. I called 9 days after purchase and was told they can take 10 days. i had been told i would receive the email within a few hours. I have now tried to ring twice more and both times the machine informs me there is a 10 minute wait so no success yet.
1454,l asked for a quote for home contents insurance online within a few minutes l got a telephone call off  from a very helpful lady who went through a questionaire and sorted out the best cover for mel was so impressed with the customer serviveprice and ease of the whole process that l signed up straight away without getting any other quotes.Excellant service.

1461,"This was the 2nd home insurance I had bought from . It was for a house we are doing some cosmetic work on before moving in fully and selling our current home. So it was a bit complicated to arrange I thought. But not for ! The customer service adviser at the call centre was great. He talked me through the options and made sure all eventualities were covered at the best possible price for me.
I manage my current policy online and was able to do so with the new one too. The documents were available really quickly and everything was correct.The only small criticism is that I need to login separately to view each policy but not a huge problem
All in all a stress free experience and I know I have a suitable policy at a reasonable price and can depend on good customer service.

Look forward to a long happy relationship.

Happy to recommend ."
1466,The house insurance gives good cover and it is a big advantage to have the contents insurance in the same policy. I found the sales force to be a bit pushy as it takes time to properly consider what is covered and to compare and get quotes from other insurers. At the end of the day  came out best for me and I took out a policy with them.
1467,only took one phone call to get the best price for my home insurancewas so pleased how easy and friendly the man from  was and the price he gave me was a pleasent surprise signed up straight away would recomend .
1468,From getting a quote for my house insurance to the payment was very easy.
1469,I received an email with the offer of M&S vouchers if I purchased my insurance on line with . As my insurance was due for renewal I checked  prices and decided to buy on line I was unable to change the date on line due to problems with the site so ended up phoning I asked if I would still get my vouchers as I had to buy the insurance over the phone the adviser said he would email me. I received an email advising me I would get a reply after 7 working days which I did not get I sent an email - no reply so ended up phoning them I am still waiting for my vouchers.
1470,Good service and better quote than competitors Easy to contact if need to speak to a person although online application very consumer friendly

Customer service personnel were very polite efficient and knowlegable and seamlessly completed the home insurance transaction"
1474,"House (and contents) both cars both lives and two AVCs with . Not had to make any claims - and hope I dont have to - but all good value products and much less expensive than other companies. Telephone support has been excellent - operators polite knowledgeable and very efficient.
Can thoroughly recommend ."
1475,"After spending several hours online comparing prices and talking to several unhelpful (and potentially expensive) brokers we found that just picking up the phone to  and by explaining our specific requirements they were able to help. The cover is exactly what we require no guessing or assumptions on what is covered. In fact I would go so far to say more is covered this year than last for about the same cost.

Customer service team were some of the politest people I have dealt with recently.

Many thanks "
1476,"We have used this company before for my wifes car insurance. We did unfortunatly have to claim but this was done with no fuss and in a timely manner.

Then asked to ring Avila for more information very quick to get through person on the phone was very obliging & went right through the quote with me asking if I wanted to delete or add anything and answered any questions i asked plainly He then gave me a very reasonable quote of which I accepted He then went through payment details terms and conditions ie cancelling etc. couldnt have been easier Very pleased.
1478,I WAS AMAZED WHEN I WAS TOLD THE COST OF MY INSURANCE ESPECIALLY WITH THE COVER I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH COVER FOR SO LESS I KNOW WHERE TO TO GO NEXT TIME.
1479,"My home insurance policy was shortly to be renewed however the premium quoted by my existing provider seemed rather extortionate. The price quoted by l was more than competitive for the same level of cover.  is now my home insurance provider and I will be
returning later in the year to purchase / renew my car insurance too!"
1480,"Bought home and contents insurance from  after trawling all the comparison sites.
Application form was easy and quick to complete.
Extremely happy with cost of policy will be recommending to my friends and family."
1481,I was applying for a policy that had a bonus attached to it if the application was made online. Unfortunately I hit a snag because I needed extra cover on a particular item and so I had to phone  Customer Services. The operator made sure that I will still receive the online bonus even though she had to help me out. Obviously Im well chuffed that I decided to move to .

A satisfied customer"
1484,good value for moneyvery easey. to set up with coustomer service agent on phone..
1485,Had an extremely helpful and courteous member of  staff discuss with me on Live Chat my insurance requirements and was able to satisfy my insurance needs at a very competitive price.
1486,Very easy to set up both on-line and when I inadvertently made a mistake the staff on the telephone were very understanding friendly and efficient. Did a lot of research/comparisons beforehand and  came out on top in both price and what you get for your money. I would definitely recommend them and use them for any future insurance I may require. I cannot praise the staff enough!
1487,"Have recently used  Medical Ins and renewed Car Ins with .
All very easy to claim and renew via their Web site and UK based English speaking call centres.
Good value Home Ins made even better by a further existing customer discount."
1488,after viewing various offers i spoke with customer services and was very pleased with the way things were explained to me . Most important thing was i was not pressured in any way .
1489,"I am somewhat bias in regard to  as I am a shareholder but I also keep a keen eye on prices.This year I have my both cars and buildings and content insurances with  as the price for all 3 were unbeatable.
I would not hesitate to renew provided these prices were maintained within reason."
1490,It was so easy to get the insurance and would use the website everytime.
1491,This policy is ideal. I needed a House and Contents policy that did not break the bank unneccisarily. This gave me what I wanted at a much better price than any other company.
1492,"Overall ease of ordering with great value for money. Confirmation of policy arrived by email super quickly.
Only hope if I have to make a claim I will as pleased. Havent made a claim in 20 years!"

1496,All the staff I encountered were polite and helpful in providing the best advice to cover my requirements and with their backup and online information it was less traumatic than normal for this pensioner. Thank you.
1497,The reason why I put the ease of purchase as poor was that I wanted to change my payment method from a one-off payment to monthly direct debit. This was not as easy as you may think...the current policy had to be cancelled and a new one started so all my details had to be given again!
1498,A competitively priced policy. Easy to access on the internet and update if appropriate. I emailed customer service to amend a policy and I was contacted within 24 hours and my policy was amended and available to view on line. I decided to use  because of their price including an online discount and a discount for having more than policy with them.
1499,Big saving made on taking buildings and contents insurance together compared to paying separately . Really appreciated loyalty bonus element.
1500,I have been really pleased with the service I have received when dealing with  nice to call and speak straight to an advisor and also I perfer to deal straight with the insurance company and not through a broker.
1501,Excellent value for money compared to my previous policy with a different provider but with all of the same benefits and cover. I bought the policy online and unfortunately it wasnt clear as to when the the policy would start and due to an error it went live on that same date.I then contacted the customer helpline who were extremely helpful and cancelled my policy and set up an identical policy but on the required start date. Excellent quality of service this is the way to run a business.Well done !
1502,I have had insurance with  and decided to get a quotation for building and contents insurance. Excellent and prompt service with excellent and very competetive prices.
1503,"In order to get clarity spoke to an operator using the number on the web site. The operator was very clear in her explenation and advised me so I could relate the like for like parts and advise me on a special requirement that I had.
At the end of the conversation and already being an existing customer for car and van insurance I purchased the home & contents policy with some confidence and the knowledge that I did get a good deal.

I do have a concern that this was a new customer package and when the year is up will be hit by a serious increase in price I have said that because of recent experiences in insurance this is why I looked at  first. I will if needed review all possible companies in order to get the best price but I was led to believe I will still get a great deal at renewal time - we shall see."
1504,Ended up with comparable home and contents insurance cover at the best available price. The website is not the easiest to follow round but it was well worth the effort. Im very satisfied.
1505,"I found  via an internet insurance compare site. The information given on site was clear and was quickly followed up with a phone call expanding any outstanding question I wanted to ask.
The pricing was very competitive and I quickly set up a payment scheme with them for the home and contents cover. I have been very pleased with the service so far. I hope in the unfortunately and unlikely event of a claim that their response is just as good."
1506,"I previously an  customer but left to go to another provider however i am glad to be back.
The premium that i was quoted was very competetive
i will be looking to  for my Car Insurance quote shortly

1510,Taking out an  Insurance policy couldnt be easier or cheaper. I would recommend them to anyone. They take the tome to ensure that the policy is what you want.

Level of cover for price is great."
1522,Information on the cover very clear and easy to set up payment
1523,"I looked at several comparison sites and I received an email from  as I have a Pension with them.
When I put my house details in to the  quote I was very surprised at the competative price that I received.
I checked the cover through and it gave me everything that I required. I had no hesitation in purchasing the policy.
Other companies rang me up and tried to convince me that they offered better cover but the prices were far higher. On a like for like basis  were the best and the web site lets you chop and change to suit your exact requirement.
Obviously the proof of the pudding will be if I have ever to make a claim and hopefully I will not have to.
I look forward to obtaining a quotation for my car insurance when due."

And I feel the service I have received so far is first class.

1527,Having earlier experienced very competitive quotation for motor insurance on two separate occasions I was hoping for a similar reception when I rang for a quotation for property and contents insurance. s quote for comparative cover exceeded my wildest expectation less than half my existing providers quote and I was more than happy to accept.The response to an unexpected change in cover was met with an amended schedule by return of post within 24 hours of my telephone call. Well done !

1535,1st time with Avila much cheaper than other companys easy to join on Internet will check when my car insurance is due
1536," offered me a good value quote beating all others as it is not too easy find insurers for flat roofs.

Purchasing online was easy and hassle-free and I got the documents within minutes instead of waiting on the letter by post. Well still needs to seen if I get the promised ï¿½30.00 Marks&Spencer Vouchers but even without that the policy is good value.

Thankfully I never had to claim and it remains to be seen how  scores at claim handling.

The only thing that is really driving me nuts is their computerised telephone service. It always hangs up when asking for my surname. \Sorry  I didnt recognise that. Could you repeat it please?\ I KNOW my name  but apparently computer does not. I find it embarassing having to try all kinds of mis-pronounciations for my name before getting through. Otherwise  the customer service is english-speaking and very friendly."
1537,Quite simply you provided the products I wanted at a competitive price with the minimum of fuss.
1538,Our home and its contents are safely looked after by .
1539,One of the easiest sites I have used and what great deals.
1540,If it had not been for a phone call to the help desk I would not have known that my insurance was in place for the internet service was and still is unable to access my policy. I was very lucky to talk to a  employee who understood my problem and solved it imediatly
1541,I would recommened  to anyone. It certainly pays to have multicar insurance and home insurance because of the service and discounts that are offered.
1542,Very pleased with service provided by call centre to provide the cover I needed
1543,Easy transaction. Good policy proof will be in the pudding.
1544,"I was considering changing my Building & Contents Insurance for quite some time but never got around to taking the first step. Being a bit old in the tooth I do not like change and it was my daughter who showed me how to get on line and to check out each provider. I was paying nearly three times the monthly premium that I now pay and the cover provided by  is far superior to what I had previously.

I must admit it did take me a bit of time to pick out  but their application form was clear and simple and I got a good quote. Like I have said previously I am a bit old in the tooth and do not understand computers very well. I therefore rang  Customer Services and the young lady I dealt with was excellent she explained everything and I signed up. Within two hours I received all the documentation by E Mail and this was followed up several days later by hard copy booklets which explain the contract in detail. Well done ."
1545,policy easy and clear to understand - not lots of hidden clauses. very good value - was half of my original quote with another insurance company - and gave better cover. customer service second to none. brilliant.

1548,pleased with purchase the policy was explained simply and clearly it is excellent value for money. the ease of purchase was painless
1549,I have recently returned to  for my building & home contents insurance. There value for money was terrific and no other insurance company came close to their price. So pleased to have them again as my insurers as I had previously been with them for 3-4 years and when I had to claim it was such an easy process. None of the nonsense of getting quotes etc. They have a team of their own to do the work. I would highly recommend them to all.
1550,I am really happy the way customer service. They were very helpful and dealt with all my enquiries affeciently
1551, gave an unbeatable quote for home and contents insurance. We have an annuity with them so the home insurance was a second product and we so were offered a 50% reduction on an already competitive quote. We will look into car insurance when that is due for renewal.
1552,Bought online but contacted by customer servcices to make sure all was ok.
1553,went online and changed my house insurance with no fuss at all good value and easely done

1556,Aiva are just great they focus on my needs and the insurance i needed for my home. Iam more than happy with the experience ive had with them and hope they can beat my car insurance when it runs out
1557,Easy enough to set up single payment option helpful. Seems like a comprehensive policy although of course we wont know how good  really are unless I make a claim!
1558,"I selected through  via Quidco having looked at 1 or 2 alternatives. Process fine product & price fine however my purchase has not shown up on Quidco. I now fine I have to go though a claim process something not found with other competitors.

Apart from this great service but it will challenge future dealings"
1559,"The buying experience was smooth helpful & polite
The policies arrived with the details mixed up
What should have been a similar experience to sort this out is totally frustrating
I am completely unable to reach the correct human to correct the company error & there is no clear way on line. I made numerous calls over several days to no avail
Finally resorted to the complaints procedure and have received no contact
It is not acceptable to provide a good sale service then impossible after sales"
1560,Very good premium quote for an excellent product. Very quick and easy to purchase online. Already had car insurance .Having made a motoring claim in 2010 which was dealt with speedily and efficiently I had no hesitation in purchasing house insurance
1561,I was very happy with the quote that I got from avivia as it was better than any of the other quote that I recevied. The people were very helpful.
1562," ! were very competetivein their Quote ! + as I had searched on line telephoned and adjusted their quoteas I added to said policy.
The policy arrived a little over a week lateras I have only now purchased said policyI cant realy comment that much more.

Down side  ! resend emails regarding quote !eg your quote is stll vallideven after you have purchasedbut! dont worry ! alls okay though you would think \ Hey they have taken my money! and havent proccessed my policy!\."
1563,Very helpful. Good knowledge of products and made sure you were buying the right product for you and were covered for all your needs. Better value than previous insurers.
1564,fast easy and simple. just the job. hope its as easy if I ever have to claim- touch wood!
1565,"Most helpful contact very understanding and -
patient. Minimum of fuss and completed within minutes - thank you for your help"
1566,I bought this because it was an excellent deal - cheaper than the rest but with the same features and a discount for buying combined insurance. Pleasant and helpful lady on the phone when I was having problems with the website.
1567,Really impressed with this policy. Easy to obtain an on line quote and retrieve. Provided more added value features than any previous quotes for the price. In fact decided to add on additional features and still beat other quotes with less to offer!
1568,I decided to look at my house insurance policy and did not expect to get a worthwhile deal. I had contact with  and on three occasions (one of which was a follow up call from )and I was extremely please with the service and the price I received. The Customer Support team were very helpful and friendly and made the whole experience pleasant. This was totally opposite to the company I originally had my policy with who were rude beyond belief.
1569,"I needed home contents insurance as within a couple of weeks my existing policy expired. I had received some quotes but early one evening a member of the  loyalty team rang me. He knew my policy was up for renewal so talked me through the policy  could offer. The guy was polite efficient and most importantly of all he actually lisened to what I wanted rather than simply read a script.
After a few moments he came up with a quote which was significantly better than most I had received earlier from other companies.
We went through everything to double check for accuracy and at that point I agreed with everything and verbally signed on the dotted line.
I paid for the full year there and then on debit card and my called gave me the policy number for me to keep a record of. He told me that my policy would be sent within two weeks to my home. It arrived a few days later.
The process was excellent and the loyalty team member I already have  car insurance was first class."
1570,"Reduced my previous premiums by 50% for the same cover!
Value from a respected company how good is that?
Im very happy."
1571,"Bought Contents insurance online - straightforward experience especially as I had the option of online chat. What wowed me immediately afterwards was the Sales Adviser calling me to ensure I had a good experience and was there anything else I needed help with.

Great customer experience."
1572,I was pleased yto purchase your buildings and contents insurance together with additional emergency cover for my central heating system. I was not so pleased when I rang on Friday 18th January (just one day after my renewal) because I thought I had a problem with my heating system pump to be told that I do not qualify for call out for 14 days. I think this is grossly unfair. I do not commit fraud and had had my emergency cover with another insurer for at least 3 years and have never used it. I had in fact paid my premium a week before I needed to and  were quite happy to take my full years payment. The problem I had with my heating pump seems to have resolved itself but I did not feel very happy about this and the fact that I might have had to call out another heating engineer if the problem had persisted. I bought this insurance because I thought it represented good value and  was a name I trusted. I really did not expect to be treated like this. I am a pensioner
1573,We are encouraged to submit a quote on the internet but you still have to ring for final details this is not clear from the internet.
1574,As a builder I just needed a cheap no frills insurance for the worse case
1575,Everything explained from the outset and helpavailable throughout. All I need included in the insurance.
1576,THe service was excellent and the product was fully described and fitted all the criteria I asked for.
1577,Good Value for money rang helpline and received prompt and informative information
1578,"I saved over ï¿½200.00 against my policy at lloyds as I have never had a claim I cant judge whether any better in that respect and hope I never have to
It was easy to set up and had a very helpful advisor

Thanks"
1579,Ease of use immediate cover would have liked copy of policy sent in post
1580,"The telephone sales process was very good all bases covered and very little problems. The representative phoned back when he said he would at the time agreed - excellent. Price and payment method dealt with effectively and all completed in two phone calls.

The only problems I have experienced since agreeing the product is:

1. The lack of a hard copy to allow ne to read all the literature at my leisure and in comfort - I do not do reading from a computer screen.

2. Emails telling me the quote is still valid (3) and asking for feedback (2). After accepting the product I dont need a quote. I cannot comment until after cheking the product to ensure it is exactly what I wanted and agreed.

Overall the feedback is very positive just me being fussy maybe."
1581,Never had to make a claim yet but if they are as efficient at that as they were outlining the policies and cover I dont think Ill have any problems. I have 2 cars the house contents and buildings insured with them so they will always negotiate premiums which is a big plus in this day and age. Staff always courteous and helpful as well.
1582,"Having tried the comparison sites which left me confused and unable to make a decision I went to the  site directly and found it easy to negotiate and assess my options.
The whole process was easy to follow and I am delighted that we have insurance that covers all our needs and came in at a very competative price.
I did pay extra for delivery of policy by post but felt that this was worth the very minimal expense.
In my situation caring for my disabled husband I need to be able to have important information to hand so that I am able to actshould I need to quickly and without hassleI believe  gives me that peace of mind."
1583,"I received my renewal notice on my home insurance and decided to give  a try as they already had my car insured with them. I was pleasantly surprised by the quote I got from them and immediately signed up. By comparing all the contents of my insurance it was clear to me that there was no reason for me to stay with my current insurer. Almost 50% cheaper for the same cover!!!!
Thats me - Im hooked on ..."
1584,"Although the policy is very good my customer experience was not so good see my comments below. However the staff were courteous and very helpful.

I did web comparison shortly after this I was called by  they wanted me to go through all of the information again.

On two occasions I was called by  each time I was asked to repeat my full name address and date of birth. Presumably this is for a recorded proof of my answers fine but when speaking from memory a person could easily give the odd unintended (and unnoticed) incorrect answer (I did have to call  back to clarify one point).

As it is important for correct answers to be given I believe it is essential to give the customer a written record of what was said. Accordingly I presume that all of the answers will be forwarded with the policy (not yet received). I would even prefer to sign and return a proper statement to  rather than rely on a verbal record that I do not have access to)."
1585,"Excellent service
Excellent price
Excellent product"
1586,The quote proved very competitive and was a deciding factor (combined with the excellent Customer Service staff) in my switch to .
1587,All done in a few minutes and real value for money...recommended
1588,Site was straight forward and simple to follow.A good experience overall
1589,Good / efficient product - Never going to set the world alight with interest but easy to buy etc.
1590,"We were delighted with the available offers from  when looking for our house insurance. On top of good cover levels and a decent premium the offer of a loyalty discount for already having car insurance with  and M&S vouchers was a plus. We searched all the usual comparison sites but with a lower premium the offers and being a well known company we decided to switch.

Online sign up was a simple process and with online documents and policy servicing it means we are in control and have access to the documents online anywhere. It is nice to know we can amend the policy online to avoid admin fees that at some companies are stupidly high for even the smallest of changes.

When I called customer services to ask a few questions they were polite friendly and helpful.

Overall a quick and simple sign-up process for a product with better cover levels and premium."
1591,I had looked at price comparison sites and nothing seem right one was good on some things others were better on other parts of what I wanted  hit the spot straight away and having the car insurance with them I got a discount
1592,A quality service provided.takes along time to receive letters through post
1593,easy to buy great value would recommend to others very good
1594,Contact was easyresponse was quickservice was excellentpremiums competitive and affordableevery reason to add House & Contents policy to my Dual car Policy.
1595,I am not a person who has time for telephone selling but I must admit to buying in this manner on this occasion. As usual its normal to receive numerous quotes for home insurance around the renewal time. I had quotes from all the usual suspects. Then a very pleasant lady called me because I have my car insurance through  and easily beat all other quotes and included extras the others did not offer. I am therefore very pleased with the cover and the cost.
1596,Very efficient thorough & helpful. pleasant and a comprehensive policy.
1597,I found the companys services didnt provide what I wanted. The attitude of the sales personnel whas that I should adapt to their services. I found a great insurance deal for my needs elsewhere. When my other policy expires I shall be moving that too.
1598,"My original quotation was via the  website the easiest task one could expect with a pleasent surprise at the size of the quote at the end.
I then had `ringbacks` from  Help desk who then very simply went through my quotation. One or two alterations were made and I very happily agreed that I had a very good deal and so the cover for my Home and its Contents was purchased."
1599,"Customer service extremely helpful fully explained each part of the policy in full so it was completely understandble and no hidden extras or sales pitch.

Telephoned me back on the day I requested at time I requested to activate the plan."
1600, provided a great price and a great discount through my work related benefits scheme. I will recommend to my collegues
1601,"I needed to renew my current home insurance but wanted a change from the company I was with. I remembered that  also did Home Insurance and thought why not give it a go. The customer service advisor I got over phone was very good and very patient. Nothing was too much trouble. All my questions and concerns were answered in a professional manner. The advisor even went through different policies I could have step by step even one tailored to my own needs great! I now have a product that gives me a more piece of mind that I am covered and dont have to worry and was assured that I could add extra benefits at a later stage should I need them. Therefore I felt no pressure to complete all benefits that is on offer at the time of completing my policy.
I went away very satisfied that I have sorted an important thing on my to do list."
1602,The quote was very straightforward and easy to complete. What I liked most was the clearly laid out details of what the policy covered.
1603,Good value for money like for like against other insurers made better by the M&S VOUCHERS which definitely clinched the deal.
1604,I obtained quote not sure of a specific areas telephoned and spoke to lady who answered my question and made sure policy on risk and emailed documents saved ï¿½10 per month.
1605,Having just received my home insurance renewal quote I decided to try  as I had got a good deal on my car insurance last year.I had a few problems with the website but in no time I had a telephone call from one of the  team.We quickly went through the quoteadjusted it to my needs and I was surprised to find I could get equivalent cover at a substantial saving.I accepted the quotepaid for it there and then. 10 out of 10 for ease of completing the deal.
1606,I found this to be a very easy product to obtain through the internet although I had to check up owith a telephone call as it seemed to good to be true
1607,Shame that a the requested hard copy of the policy was promised but not delivered. Cost savings..........or does one worry about claims proceedure ?
1608,I have been a customer of  for several years and made the mistake last year of changing companies in an effort to save costs. I had my car and house insured with them and moved both insurances to another company. I soon realised that I had made a mistake because the new company soon started to increase the premiums until they were 33% more than the premiums I was paying . When I first tried to cancel these policies the new company tried to charge me a whole years premiums just to cancel on top of what I had already paid. They didnt succeed but I feel far more secure now that in back with  .
1609,"The person to whom I spoke explained things fully.
Having shopped around for the type of policy I required Avila ticked all the boxes."
1610,I had your house insurance as it was good value for money
1611,Very efficient and helpful in answering all of my questions
1612,I did not like that the company wanted extra money to send the injurence papers out by letter. I always like a paper form. I am still waiting for the hard copy of the injurence.
1613,I contacted  with regards to our Home and Contents Insurance as we already have our cars insured and found that when we went online with our information the price we were quoted was very acceptable. We did need to telephone with a query but were dealt with in a very professional manner and would definitely and have told our family and friends about the experience.
1614,I first dealt with  when I had to insure my mums house. They were so helpful that I decided to take my home insurance with them this year. Very competitive and an user friendly website too. I would definately recommend them to friends and family.
1615,Rang  to update address on our multi-car policy. At the same time I was able to obtain a very competitive quote for our contents insurance (less than we were paying with another company). I accepted the quote and the cover was in place immediately. I was able to check all the details online - its so handy having all your policies online if you ever want to check anything. It certainly saves ferreting through loads of paperwork!
1616,"Product is sufficient - good coverage with enough options to tailor the product for me.

Customer services were exceptional - terrific advice from start to end.

Price is acceptable - the cost is more than going with others but this is compensated for with: (1) flexible product options; and (2) superb customer services."
