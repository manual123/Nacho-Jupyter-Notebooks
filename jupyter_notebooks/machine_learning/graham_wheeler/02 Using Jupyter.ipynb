    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is an interactive computing environment that allows users to create heterogeneous documents called *notebooks* that can mix executable code, [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) text with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), multimedia, static and interactive charts, and more. A notebook is typically a complete and self-contained record of a computation, and can be converted to various formats and shared with others. Jupyter thus supports a form of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Jupyter is an extremely popular tool for doing data science in Python due to its interactive nature, good support for iterative and experimental computation, and ability to create a finished artifact combining both scientific text (with math) and code. It's easiest to start to understand this by looking at an [example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Economics.ipynb) of a finished notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter the application combines three components:\n",
    "<!-- TEASER_END -->\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The notebook application**: An front-end interactive application for writing and running code interactively and authoring notebook documents. There are multiple different front-ends available, running on the CLI, natively, or in a browser. The most commonly used front-end is [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) which runs in the browser, although it is due to be replaced by the newer [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) which is currently in beta. As of this writing (April 2018) I recommend using JupyterLab on Mac and Linux but Jupyter Notebook on Windows, as there seem to be some issues still with getting JupyterLab running on Windows. \n",
    "- **Kernels**: These are separate processes started by the notebook application that runs the user’s code in a given language and returns output back to the notebook application. The kernel also handles things like computations for interactive widgets, tab completion and introspection. The original kernel was Python and the old version of Jupyter that was for Python only was called IPython; the name was changed to Jupyter to remove the language dependency as kernels now exist for a [number of different languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels), and IPython is used now to refer to the Python environment for Jupyter. In this overview we are only going to consider that environment.\n",
    "- **Notebook documents**: Self-contained documents (JSON text in files with .ipynb extension) that contain a representation of all content visible in the notebook application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, text, images, and more. A notebook can be *running* which means it is attached to a kernel. Each notebook document has its own kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks consist of a linear sequence of cells of various types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code cells**: live code that is run in the kernel, and the output from running that code\n",
    "- **Markdown cells**: text cells formatted with mrkdown with embedded LaTeX (MathJax) equations\n",
    "- **Heading cells**: Up to 6 hierarchical levels of header text (I usually don't use these and just put my headings in markdown cells, but using heading cells can be useful for outline views of a document or table of contents)\n",
    "- **Raw cells**: Unformatted text that is included, without modification, when notebooks are converted to different formats using the conversion utility [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter documentation is available at https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. You can read more about the architecture of Jupyter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/how_jupyter_ipython_work.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and Running JupyterLab (Mac/Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Mac and Linux, if you have the Anaconda distribution of Python, install JupyterLab with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n",
    "    \n",
    "or with pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "    \n",
    "and run with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter lab\n",
    "    \n",
    "Jupyter Lab will open in a web browser tab displaying a main menu along the top, a file browser on the left listing the notebooks and files in the current directory, and a tabbed interface on the right for open notebooks, terminals, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/interface_jupyterlab.png](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/interface_jupyterlab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Jupyter Notebook (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, use Jupyter Notebook, which is installed as part of the Anaconda distribution, and can be launched directly from Anaconda Navigator or from an Anaconda Python console with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    " \n",
    "This should open a web browser pointing at the notebook dashboard, which displays the notebooks and files in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/dashboard_files_tab.png](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/dashboard_files_tab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook uses separate browser tabs for each notebook and the filebrowser rather than integrating everything within one browser tab like JupyterLab; nonetheless is should be fairly straightforward to follow along).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The top of the notebook list displays clickable breadcrumbs of the current directory. By clicking on these breadcrumbs or on sub-directories in the notebook list, you can navigate your file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new notebook, use the menu option \"File - New - Notebook\" (JupyterLab), click on the “New” button at the top of the list and select a kernel from the dropdown menu. Which kernels are listed depend on what’s installed on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file manager shows a green dot next to running notebooks (as seen below). Notebooks remain running until you explicitly shut them down; closing the notebook’s page is not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the running notebooks and shutdown a notebook, click the \"Running\" tab on the left side of the window, and then the \"Shutdown\" button next to the notebook in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete, duplicate, or rename a notebook right-click on it in the file browser; a context menu will show with these options along with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you create a new notebook or open an existing one, you will be taken to the notebook user interface within a tab, which allows you to run code and author notebook documents interactively. The notebook UI has a toolbar at the top, followed by the notebook area below, which consists of one or more *cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook UI is modal. If you click in a cell or press ENTER you enter \"edit mode\" and can type into the cell. If you click outside a cell or press ESC you will be in \"command mode\" which allows you to edit the notebook structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute a code cell or render a markdown cell by pressing Shift-ENTER. Focus will move to the next cell (a new cell will be created if you executed the last cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason your notebook kernel hangs (e.g. waiting on some I/O that never happens, or due to a long running process), you can interrupt the execution by selecting \"Interrupt Kernel\" from the Kernel menu."
