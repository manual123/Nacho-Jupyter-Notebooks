# Introductory Data Science with Python

In this bootcamp, we will cover:

- Up and running with Conda
- Jupyter basics
- Python language crash course
- Basic data science tasks with pandas
- Basic machine learning with SciKit-Learn

Before you arrive, please download and install Conda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ 

Then run these commands from a terminal:

    conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension

For a concise language reference, see: https://github.com/mattharrison/Tiny-Python-3.6-Notebook

To start, clone this repo, change into the repo directory, and run this command from a terminal:

    jupyter notebook

This should open a web browser page with a list of the notebooks; start with "02 Using Jupyter.ipynb".
