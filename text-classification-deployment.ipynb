    "# Deploying Text Classification Model in Jarvis\n",
    "\n",
    "[Transfer Learning Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/transfer-learning-toolkit) (TLT) provides the capability to export your model in a format that can deployed using [NVIDIA Jarvis](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-jarvis), a highly performant application framework for multi-modal conversational AI services using GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores taking an .ejrvs model, the result of `tlt text_classification export` command, and leveraging the Jarvis ServiceMaker framework to aggregate all the necessary artifacts for Jarvis deployment to a target environment. Once the model is deployed in Jarvis, you can issue inference requests to the server. We will demonstrate how quick and straightforward this whole process is. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:  \n",
    "- Use Jarvis ServiceMaker to take a TLT exported .ejrvs and convert it to .jmir\n",
    "- Deploy the model(s) locally  on the Jarvis Server\n",
    "- Send inference requests from a demo client using Jarvis API bindings..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "To follow along, please make sure:\n",
    "- You have access to NVIDIA NGC, and are able to download the Jarvis Quickstart [resources](https://ngc.nvidia.com/resources/ea-jarvis-stage:jarvis_quickstart/)\n",
    "- Have an .ejrvs model file that you wish to deploy. You can obtain this from `tlt <task> export` (with `export_format=JARVIS`). Please refer the tutorial on *Text Classification using Transfer Learning Toolkit* for more details on training and exporting an .ejrvs model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jarvis ServiceMaker\n",
    "Servicemaker is the set of tools that aggregates all the necessary artifacts (models, files, configurations, and user settings) for Jarvis deployment to a target environment. It has two main components as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Jarvis-build\n",
    "\n",
    "This step helps build a Jarvis-ready version of the model. Itâ€™s only output is an intermediate format (called a JMIR) of an end to end pipeline for the supported services within Jarvis. We are taking a ASR QuartzNet Model in consideration<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`jarvis-build` is responsible for the combination of one or more exported models (.ejrvs files) into a single file containing an intermediate format called Jarvis Model Intermediate Representation (.jmir). This file contains a deployment-agnostic specification of the whole end-to-end pipeline along with all the assets required for the final deployment and inference. Please checkout the [documentation](http://docs.jarvis-ai.nvidia.com/release-1-0/) to find out more."
