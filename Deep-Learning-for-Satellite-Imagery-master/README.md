# Deep-Learning-for-Satellite-Imagery

This repository holds some personal projects in applying deep learning to satellite imagery/Remote Sensing. My interest is in Land Cover/Land use applications and object detecion.







## Land Use / Land Cover Classification
1. Austin Zoning Satellite Images - How to classify the zoning of satellite pictures of the city of Austin?

![Zoning Code Sample](https://github.com/shakasom/Deep-Learning-for-Satellite-Imagery/blob/master/zoning.png)

The Austin Zoning Satellite Images dataset is hosted in Kaggle. It is small dataset(3667 satellite images) with a well defined and fine grained classification labels. Training the dataset with a simple convolution Neural Network (CNN) results in almost 0.90 accuracy.
