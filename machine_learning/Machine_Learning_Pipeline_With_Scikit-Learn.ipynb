    "# A Real-Life Massive Machine Learning Pipeline with scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to build a scikit-learn pipeline that takes in raw data, transforms many different subsets of data, learns from it, tunes hyperparameters and is then able to make predictions. The final outcome will be a single sckit-learn estimator that does it all. This estimator will then be able to be used in the future to make predictions in a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial includes information on how to:\n",
    "* Categorize columns into distinct groups\n",
    "* Apply independent transformations to each column grouping\n",
    "* Create a single pipline that handles all the steps of transforming, modeling, validating, and predicting\n",
    "* Build custom transformers to create new features\n",
    "* Save our final model to disk to be used to make future predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus on transformations\n",
    "Although this builds a complete machine learning pipeline, most of it will focus on how to transform and prepare the data for the machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assume fundamentals of scikit-learn\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with doing machine learning with scikit-learn. At a minimum, you need to know what a scikit-learn estimator is and how it behaves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior Issues with transformations in scikit-learn\n",
    "Up until the release of scikit-learn version 0.20 in September, 2018, there was no easy way to apply separate transformations to different subsets of the data. Additionally burdensome, was encoding of categorical features. For instance, building a single pipeline to handle input data that contained a mix of continuous and categorical variables was not trivial and a huge issue. Many divergent workflows were built to accommodate such transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of the `ColumnTransformer` and upgrade to the `OneHotEncoder` in version 0.20 alleviated these painful issues. Building an entire pipeline in scikit-learn was not pleasant before these additions. A previous post of mine details the exciting new workflow that became possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Data\n",
    "In this post, we will work with the [Ames, Iowa housing dataset][0] from a popular Kaggle competition. You are given a dataset with 79 features with the objective of learning a model to predict the sale price.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Begin by reading in data\n",
    "Let's begin by reading our training data into a pandas DataFrame."

    "One of the most important tasks during this tutorial is going to be the classification of each column into a particular group. Each group will undergo its own set of transformations before being used as input in the machine learning model. A commonly taught approach is to classify each column as either **categorical** or **continuous**. Values in categorical columns are discrete and typically the total number of categories is known. Continuous columns are always numeric and not limited to a known set of values.\n",

All the transformed subsets are then concatenated together to form a single dataset.\n",

    "### Replacing low-frequency categorical values\n",
    "Before we get started transforming groups of columns, we can look at individual columns for particular values that appear very few times (sometimes referred to as outliers).  Categorical values that appear infrequently are candidates to be reclassified as a another similar category or to be grouped together with other infrequent categories into an 'other' category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why recclassify low-frequency categoricals?\n",
    "A primary goal of machine learning is to build a model that generalizes well to future, unseen data. If our model is built with too many low-frequency categorical values, it may overfit to those particular categories. As a concrete example, imagine that there are just 2 houses in our training data from a particular neighborhood and both of these houses, by chance, just happen to be very poor quality houses and are not representative of the entire neighborhood. Our model might unfairly give too much negative weight to that neighborhood and then make poor predictions in the future.\n",

    "Of course, this isn't always the case and a single unique category can actually give useful information. Perhaps there is a single house that has a solid-gold toilet that massively increases the value of the house. \n",
