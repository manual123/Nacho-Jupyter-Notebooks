Not sure who to go to since it seems Acura isn't doing anything about it.

I brought it in 4 times to the dealer and the first three times they did something related to a TSB that was issued without being able to solve the problem. Went back in the 4th time and the dealership unplugged the VCM (variable cylinder control module) and had me take it for a test drive and it corrected the issue. I was told that this is how they were designed and that there was nothing else that they could do to fix the issue. Beyond frustrated at this point and now looking to engage an attorney that can help me through the lemon law arbitration process unless Acura Client Relations can make a deal on a trade up to an MDX or RDX without the same issue. Good luck to everyone else that has the same problem!\n",

      "As reported by many others, our brand new TLX V6 AWD jerked from day 1 when it shifted somewhat between gears 1 and 2 and distinctly between gears 2 and 3. We had the software update done for the transmission in September, and it was far worse. After taking the car back and complaining about the problem, the dealer reran the learning procedure and there was some improvement. It still was nowhere near smooth. We took it back a second time and were told that it was \"operating as designed.\" It was also pointed out that we did not buy the car at that particular dealership, as if that matters. We have had the car back to the dealership where we purchased the car, and they made an effort to solve the problem but admitted that they realized it was not smooth. We were invited to meet with a district representative to discuss the problem. She rode in the vehicle and said she felt what we were talking about but explained that is how this model of car drives. We drove another vehicle of the same model from the lot and she accused my husband of driving the car differently so that it did not shift in the same way as ours. She refused to replace the transmission as we requested and also refused to give us the contacts for her superior. She basically said that there is no fix for the problem. How does a company get to admit that a product is defective but refuse to do anything about it? We are continuing to work with the dealership where we purchased this defective vehicle to come to an acceptable resolution. We would love to get rid of this piece of junk. No vehicle in this price range should drive like this. It is unsafe to pull out into traffic not knowing how much it will hesitate and jerk in the shifting process.

      "I've called corporate headquarters in California several times, and they told me I had to deal with the dealership, (just washing their hands of the situation). The dealer says they don't know what to do, unless Acura comes up with a solution. I asked to talk to a Rep. that comes to the dealer every so often, and they never notify me. Acura really screwed up with this one. In my opinion, they got rid of the best car in their fleet, the TSX, and came up with this piece of crap. \n",

There was a software glitch and later a transmission recall to fix a parking brake problem. Each time I reported a rough shifting from 1st to 2nd gear (slight) and from 2nd to 3rd gear (very pronounced) They have yet to fix the problem. I could shift a manual smoother than this \"advanced\" automatic transmission system. I am just waiting to get the next recall. I've owned several Honda and Acura cars over the years but this is the last.\n",

Took it to the dealership's service department and their response is that as of right now the car is driving as intended and there is no fix available. Also told me if there was a fix in the future, it would likely come in the form of a software update. Gear switch from 1st to 2nd has a mild hiccup. Every other gear change except for the first two is seamless.\n",

The BRAKE notification warning has come on for no reason as well. I must say I'm very disappointed in this vehicle. As a previous Toyota owner I know what it's like to own a new vehicle and not have any issues with it what-so-ever. I was attracted to the TLX because of the technology however had I known that it was going to have all these issues I would have purchased the BMW 3 series or the Audi Q4 instead. If theses issue are not resolved very soon I will be contacting the Acura corporate headquarters to make a complaint if that does nothing I will contact lemon law to see if they can help.

This is simply a bad joke that Acura, being essentially Honda that is renowned for it's quality engineering, sells a luxury vehicle that can't shift gears smoothly. This is by far the worst shifting transmission I ever drove in my life. Even the cars I drove 20 years ago were shifting smoother. It's also very unresponsive both in terms of throttle input and manual shifts, but the jerkiness is the primary complain. Really bad execution. Absolutely unacceptable in any car, but especially in one that costs as much as this one.\n",

The second time I took the car in and the dealer kept it for 21 days (remind you folks that the car had less than 350 miles on it and I had driven it for less than 12 days by then). I was told that the manufacturer was aware of the issue and was working on the controlling software. While i was still waiting, the manufacturer had sent a, in progress, transmission software update that was loaded to my car. The result was the same, very jerky and now the RPM was much higher at all speed. I drove the car with their mechanic and we were both convinced that the problem persisted. They kept the car for another 7 days and finally told me that Acura was working on a solution and they will call me when they have an update. The dealer told me if you want it fixed, you need to take it to Acura directly as the dealer did not have that much power dealing with the manufacturer problem.\n",
