    "# Boolean Selection Single Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean Selection, also referred to as **Boolean Indexing**, is the process of selecting subsets of rows from DataFrames (or Series) based on the actual data values and NOT by their labels or integer locations. All of the previous subset selections were done using either labels or integer location. Those selections had nothing to do with the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Boolean Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of actual questions (in plain English) that boolean selection can help us answer from the bikes dataset. The term **query** is used to refer to these sorts of questions.\n",

    "* Find all rides with duration longer than 2 hours\n",
    "* Find all rides that took place between March and June of 2015.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of the above queries have a strict logical condition that must be checked one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep or discard an entire row of data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to manually answer the above queries, you would need to scan each row and determine whether the row, as a whole, meets the condition. If so, then it is kept in the result, otherwise it is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each row will have a True or False value associated with it\n",
    "\n",
    "When you perform boolean selection, each row of the DataFrame (or value of a Series) has a `True` or `False` value associated with it that corresponds to the outcome of the logical condition.\n",
    "\n",

The Series must have the same index as the DataFrame it is selecting from in order to work properly, so we create it with the same index as the original DataFrame. This automatic alignment of the index is important and covered in the **Joining Data** part."
