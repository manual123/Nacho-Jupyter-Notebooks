    "Broadly speaking, time series data are simply points of data gathered over time. The time order is meaningful and typically there is only one observation per unit of time. The time will uniquely identify each record. Often, the time is evenly spaced between each data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of time series data include stock market closing prices, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, unemployement rates, etc... pandas has good functionality with regards to manipulating dates, aggregating over different time periods, sampling different periods of time, and more. Let's begin by reading in 20 years of stock market data, putting the 'timestamp' column in the index."
