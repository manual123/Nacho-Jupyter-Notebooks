    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will call many methods that perform actions on our DataFrame. We have actually already called some methods such as the `head`, `tail`, `isna`, and `set_index` methods. There are around 250 methods available to both DataFrames and Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a subset of methods\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be quite overwhelming to think about having to learn and memorize this staggering amount of functionality. The good news is that many of these methods are unnecessary and don't add any extra functionality. Furthermore, many methods are remnants from the early days of pandas and have few/no use cases or have been **deprecated**. When a method is deprecated, then it is both discouraged from being used and will likely be removed from the library in the future.\n",

    "I suggest using a subset of the pandas library that allows you to do as many tasks as possible. I focus on the subset of pandas that maximizes both performance and readability. Since there is so much functionality, power users of pandas can think of very creative and complex code to accomplish different tasks. This is not necessarily a positive thing and when working with a group of other data analysts can lead to confusion for those that are not familiar with the syntax. One of my most popular blog posts is titled [Minimally Sufficient Pandas][1] and goes into great detail on this.\n",
