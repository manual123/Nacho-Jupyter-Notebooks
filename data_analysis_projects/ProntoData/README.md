# Pronto Data

This is my entry to Pronto Cycle Share's [2015 Data Challenge](http://www.prontocycleshare.com/datachallenge).
The main analysis and discussion can be found here:

- [Digging Into the Pronto Data Release](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/ProntoData/blob/master/ProntoData.ipynb)


## Analysis Scripts
All plots and figures in that analysis are generated in Python; you can find the code in the following notebooks:

- [BasicAnalysis.ipynb](BasicAnalysis.ipynb)
- [CompareWithFremont.ipynb](CompareWithFremont.ipynb)
- [ExtremePronto.ipynb](ExtremePronto.ipynb)
- [WorkHabits.ipynb](WorkHabits.ipynb)

Also see [my blog post](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/10/17/analyzing-pronto-cycleshare-data-with-python-and-pandas/) which walks through some of the initial analysis with accompanying Python code.
