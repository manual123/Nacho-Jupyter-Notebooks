# Swirl - Learn R within R
# Swirl commands:
esc - exit swirl
bye() - exit and save
skip() - skip the current question
play() - let's you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore you until you type:
	nxt() - which will regain swirl's attention
	bye() - causes swirl to exit; progress will be saved
	main() - returns you to swirl's main menu
	info() - displays these options again
